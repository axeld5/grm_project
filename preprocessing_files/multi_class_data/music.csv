"This is awesome to listen to, A must-have for all Slayer fans..sadly needed to be a triple disc set..They have so many hits!!",1
It was great to hear the old stuff again and I like the new stuff too. I recommend it to any Slayer fan.,1
"well best of's are a bit poison normally but this is not bad it's pretty good because I'd have put 90% hell await,reign in blood,south of,seasons ,divine and a couple musica's tracks and everything on god hates -at that point best of mean every cd mainly so this is not so bad  it dose put some great tracks that live shows don't play much out there like,213, skeletons of society,sex murder art and Gemini and some rare track too,final six is just a bonus track on Christ illusion but it's here with the mystery cover songs from unditstputed attitude cd(why these would be on a greatest hits collection I don't know) but the also put a couple of live tracks on here too.all in all it could be much worse but it's great for the car.",1
"What can I say? This is Casting Crowns!!!This is a good, blessing filled, CD.",1
Another very inspirational collection by a Very popular Christian group.  Another of my Favorites.,1
"I love the song Slow Fade by Casting Crowns, especially how they put the children version at the end... its a song that speaks to everyone of us to be careful on ""itching ears"" that may take our faith and attention away from the Lord and to be watchful all the time and put on our armour at all times in the gospel. The song slow fade speaks to those who does not just live and walk in faith but also those who are still in the process of finding themselves in the walk of faith and intimate relationship with the Lord, the lyrics simply say ""people never crumble in a day... its a slow fade when you give yourself away..."" this is so true, nobody changes over night and we can start by being careful on what we feed our minds, body, ears, eyes, and soul for our body is the temple of the Lord and we are to keep it holy and live a christ-like life all the time, not just at certain times but 24/7, with or without people around us... we may not get it all right at ones, but its a ""slow fade"" when we make a conscious decision to change our ways and it starts by the choices we make on what to feed our body and soul.",1
This is an awesome album from the amazing Christian group Casting Crowns. You can't go wrong with this album. Amazing and worth the buy! I think if you like Casting Crowns you'd probably also like my current new favorite artist I found through myspace. I think they'll be as big as Casting Crowns and already starting to see a huge interest in them. See my other reviews for The Warehouse Band,1
"I can't believe I haven't written a review for this album yet! Maybe I didn't buy it from amazon, lol! I love this album to pieces. All the way from What This World Needs to Every Man, Slow Fade to all because of Jesus...great just awesome! I had the privilege of seeing this band perform at the Norfolk Scope in Norfolk, VA back last November with my brother and I tell you what..this band cares for souls! I, only being a new christian for a couple of months prior I was on a spirtual high already and this band lifted me up higher! Casting Crowns is one of those exceptional Contemporary Christian Bands that you would feel comfortable having your 6 or 8 year old son or daughter listen to. I had Lifesong and I knew how much I enjoyed that album, still there most phenomenal work to date and then picked up the debut album self titled Casting Crowns. If you want to listen to a band that actually loves Jesus and wants everyone to know it, I can guarantee this band will fulfill your craving.",1
"This latest effort by Casting Crowns is an outstanding project.  As with their other albums, it is lyrically powerful and has a great sound.  There are several very good songs on this album.  The album has a theme of challenging Christians to live their faith all the time, not just on Sunday mornings.  There are a couple of praise songs and a prayer-song included also, but most of the tracks here have a message that is very hard hitting to believers.  As with their previous albums, I think that this one will produce several hit singles.  'East To West' is already in that category.  Others that are very good include 'What The World Needs', 'Every Man', and 'Slow Fade'.  I would highly recommend this to anyone who is already a fan of Casting Crowns.  For those who are unfamiliar with their music, I would recommend starting off with their self titled debut.  In any case, this is well worth buying.",1
"I have gotten ripped on previously Casting Crowns reviews because I gave them 4 stars instead of 5...so there is no doubt people will go crazy with this review.  But with that being said, this CD just wasn't very good.  Once again Casting Crowns does what it does best - write songs pointing the finger at the church.  Yes, it was a good song with ""If We Are The Body"" and ""Does Anybody Hear Her,"" but with ""What This World Needs,"" it's just gotten old now.  It starts to become annoying when a band harps on one point, especially one that is as generalizing as saying the church isn't doing what it is supposed to.  Move on to another topic!!!  This CD also lacks the catchiness of the last 2 albums.  And where the last 2 CD's had a solid 6 or 7 songs on them, this album has 2 at most.  I just couldn't get into any of the songs.  Musically, it is average and the lyrics are not up to par.  Looking forward to the new David Crowder Band album, though, which will surely not disappoint.  Hope Casting Crowns pulls it together for its next album.  This one will sell a lot of units, but will not stand the test of time.  It will collect dust on my shelf.",1
"I remember the first time I heard Casting Crowns on the radio several years ago. It wasn't Mark Hall's voice, the band's music, or even the harmonies sung that drew me in. It was the lyrics. I was going through a situation that ""Voice of Truth"" so eloquently and accurately addressed. I honestly felt the Lord meant for me to hear that song at that particular time. I decided to go ahead and buy that album and found every song spoke volumes to me. Now here we are 3 albums later and once again, Mark and his amazing ensemble of musicians have done it again. They have put together an album that speaks volumes to my heart.  I really like the way that Casting Crowns' albums generally have a theme. This album is no exception. I find the theme throughout this album is about staying in our comfort zone also known as the middle ground- the safety zone. But he also addresses the middle as in the 'gray area' which we all have to deal with on a daily basis no doubt. Mark sings about how we all have good intentions but when it comes to stepping out of our comfort zone for God we say...'no way!'. We give God a list that says I'll do this and this but there is no way I can or will do that or that. Fear is usually the biggest reason most of us don't step out of our comfort zone. I am in no way pointing a finger because I find I am probably the guiltiest of all at doing this. That said, this album truly helps me to understand why I do what I do and how to remedy it. It inspires me to seek out the Lord in His Word and in prayer and meditation.  The first song on the album: ""What This World Needs"" is a great way to start off the album. It has a rocky edge that draws you in to its chorus and before you know it you are singing along. I actually had to listen to this song several times before I could fully appreciate what Mark was trying to say.  Song #2: Every Man- This song references the fact that no matter who we are or what we've done there is Hope for us. Hope comes in the form of Jesus Who knows how we feel and can understand what we are going through.  #3: Slow Fade- This is an amazing song that helps us realize that no one goes from being on fire for the Lord to dabbling with sin in one day. No, instead it is a slow fade. Satan knows the best attack is a gradual attack which makes black and white fade into gray.  #4: East to West- One of my favorites on this album. This is one of the songs on this album that speaks to me personally. It is with songs like this that I wonder if maybe God isn't giving Mark a look into my heart. (As if I'm the only one struggling with issues like this. ;-) )  #5: The Word Is Alive- As the title indicates, this song is about the Bible and how It brings forth hope to the hopeless and frail.  #6: The Altar and the Door- One of my favorites also. ""The Altar and the Door"" musically has a lot to offer. It is very upbeat and easy to sing along with. This song is one of the many that teaches about how we get caught in the middle and lose our follow through between the altar and the door. I believe we all are guilty of this at some point in our walk with the Lord.  #7: Somewhere in the Middle- This is my absolute favorite song on the album for several reasons. One of which is that this song is easy to sing along with and secondly, because it is such a deep song that carries a great amount of meaning. I really think it should be my ""anthem"". I admire Mark's clever word play- ""Fearless warriors on a picket fence, Reckless abandon wrapped in common sense, deep-water faith in the shallow end, We are caught in the middle with eyes wide open to the differences, The God we want and the God who is..."" What Mark illustrates here is how contrary and fickle we as the body of Christ can be. We know right from wrong and we know how to discern truth from fiction, but yet we stay in the middle ground where it is safe and easy instead of standing up for what is right...which reminds me of the great story of the three young men thrown into the fiery furnace.  #8: I Know You're There: This song is great! One of the ladies from Casting Crowns sings this. She does a terrific job and is able to carry her own without any problem. This song is about knowing that God is always there for us.  #9: Prayer for a Friend: This song, which sounds close to a ballad, is about those we are closest to getting caught up in the world and we want nothing more than to bring them back to the Lord.  #10: All Because of Jesus: This is a praise and worship song that I think will one day be sung in churches all over the world.  #11: White Dove: This song is completely different from anything Casting Crowns has ever done. I am not a big fan of it though I have to applaud them for trying something different.  I highly recommend this album to anyone who worships with music. I also recommend it to anyone who is feeling lost in this big world. Casting Crowns does a great job of helping its listener connect (or re-connect) with God.  One more note: This album is GREAT to work out with!!! I do my strength training and cardio workouts with this album. I also like jogging to this album.",1
"Christian soft rock group Casting Crowns has taken the Christian music world by storm thanks to two strong previous releases.  And their third project should continue the trend.  The group has captured audiences with challenging lyrics and great music.  There's nothing earth shattering with either, but both work together to create some great music.  The disc starts off with the rock anthem ""What This World Needs.""  Think ""If We are the Body"" but faster.  The song reminds us that the world needs Christ more then it needs 100% perfect outward appearances.  After all, the heart is what counts.  The title of the album comes from the idea that somewhere between hearing what we should do during church (the altar) and driving away (the door), we loose the certainty and conviction we had.  I'll just say been there, done that.  That theme is explored in two songs.  The first is the title track, which really explains the theme better then I ever could.  And it's rather convicting to hear my struggle put into words.  The second is the next track, ""Somewhere in the Middle.""  In fact, the phrase ""between the altar and the door"" shows up in this song, too.  The song is a challenge to get out of the luke warm world we too often live in.  As with other Casting Crown's CDs, this one features a couple worship songs.  And, once again, they don't grab me.  There's nothing wrong with ""I Know You're There"" and ""All Because of Jesus,"" but they aren't as special as some of their other tracks.  My two favorite songs are back to back.  ""Slow Fade"" is a challenge to all men to not fall away from the faith.  It really drives home the importance of constantly standing guard because no one crumbles in a day.  It's a slower song with a haunting sound.  And it ends with lead singer Mark Hall's daughter singing ""Because Little Eyes.""  It's enough to give me chills.  Appropriately enough, the next song is ""East to West.""  As you might guess, this song talks about forgiveness.  It explores the difficulty we have in accepting God's forgiveness and the weight of shame we try to live under.  As with so many of their songs, the lyrics are powerful.  Musically, there are few surprises here for the long time fan.  But that's just fine because their music is wonderful.  I'm surprised I haven't worn out Casting Crown's first two releases I've listened to them so often.  This one will certainly suffer the same fate.",1
"No one sings gospel songs with such true feelings for God and Jesus the way Elvis did. I find his gospel songs very comforting when I am upset about anything. I think you will as well.  His 2 CD set with 40 songs called ""He Touched Me"" is one of my very favorites. Sincerely, Joan Wear, Nashville, TN",1
"And I love it!  It truly is Elvis at his best.  The songs are songs I know and can sing along if I want or I can just listen to the ""real"" Elvis sing the kind of songs he loved the best - gospel!  A terrific collection!",1
"Michael Jackson has always Been Badd period. from his days as a Kid leading the Jackson5 to His Incredible Adult solo Run. His Vocal Instrument alone has touched so many lives. His Instrument of a Voice has gone through so many styles&Eras. no matter what the Era or what was the ""IN"" Sound or vibe you could always count on MJ hanging tough. His Voice as a Kid was that of a BluesMan in a Kid. He explored so many styles&Influenced so many era's of future Musicians. as a songwriter he has composed some of the Most Timeless songs Ever in ""don't Stop Till you Get Enough,Billie Jean,Beat It. His Vocals Lead&background have captured people all over the world&back.as a writer,producer,Arranger,Instrumentalist,conceptionilist,etc... He has His Own Mount Rushmore of Music Makers in the History of Making Music.for the new Listener to His Musical Genius this is a Great place to Start.",1
"It is hard to imagine enigma's from so many artists. Whether they are just pure genius, or mad as a hatter. What the music brings s actually what really should count. For Michael Jackson, he is one that has been tormented bith ways. Arguably, after his child molestation trial vindication, many wonder if he will ever be heard from again. Arguably, that will be a test from time. Nevertheless, what he has accomplished as a innovator keeps on showing in his music and his videos. Although there have been adequate collections that need improvement, there hasn't been anything loosely definitive, until now.  The Essential Michael Jackson, a collection reflection his career in three folds: Jackson 5, Jacksons, and on his own, is a double album reflecting his well-received career. The songs here have really been remastered very well and still withstand that test of Michaels' Moonwalking mayhem. The collection includes most of his biggest hits including Beat It, Wanna Be Staring Something, ABC, I Just Can't Stop Loving You, Black Or White, and You Walk My World. The compilation does show quite a lot, but like most collections, there are just a few glitches to the parade. The album overshadows a few of Michael's big tracks including Scream with Janet Jackson, Say, Say, Say with Paul McCartney, One More Chance, his last song from his Number Ones collection, and others die hard Jacko maniacs would want.  All in all, Michael Jackson was strange, but one of a kind. Yet, his music will keep everyybody rocking with him for a very long time. Hopefully, he should try to do it again soon. What ever reflection, The Essential Michael Jackson is one of the very few definitive hits collections for 2005.  Album Cover: B+  Mastering: A-  Songs: B 1/2+  Price: B  Overall: B 1/2+",1
"This is almost a definitive look at Jackson's career both with the J5 and solo.  There's still a 5 star 1 disc compilation in Jackson's future.  But as of 2005 there are none on the market.  But the 2 disc's here (compiled chronologically) move along nicely. You get the Jacksons' biggest hits and Michael's early Motown solo hits.  So, why isn't this a 5 star package?  For one there's no ""Dancing Machine"", which is a cruel trick played by Epic/Legacy to make you buy one of the numerous J5 compilations with that song on it (or just download it).  The liner notes consist of a few paragraphs that aren't worth anyone's time.  And they included ""Dangerous"" a decent album cut that's not essential.  Better choice would be ""Working Day And Night"". All told not a bad CD to have by Jackson if it's only a Greatest Hits CD you need.",1
great album it come with Michael Jackson greatest hits of his i am huge Michael Jackson fan and this was my first album ever please get it,1
it has been a while since I have bought this CD and it is okay the best of his music I already have so......,1
"Wow! This CD is full of awesome songs. Even takes you back to his early start and brings you forth as he progressed in his career. A must have, in my opinion. I grew up listening to the Jackson 5, and Michael Jackson.",1
I am very pleased with my purchase and I highly recommend this.,1
Terrific 2 CD Set 2005 Japanese Issue of all the essential Michael Jackson hits!  Thirty-Eight of his best hits that is meant to be played LOUD ! !  You can't go wrong with this set - I love it !!!,1
He knows how to beat it. Billie Jean that's his boy. FREAK!,1
"Classic Michael talent. Once a Michael fan always a Michael fan. This man just had what it took to make us dance, laugh and cry. There is only one Michael and all the rest are just imitations.",1
"An amazing cd with so many awesome songs!! For $10 this is a steal for 38 songs!!!!!! Buy it, even if you don't like MJ you'll end loving his music! It makes you want to clean, dance, sing.......be happy!!! Just puts you in a good, uplifting mood!!!",1
i stated listening to the jackson 5 when they first hit the radio stations coming out of chicago. when michael started is solo career i always stayed up with his music which as far as im concerned is the greatest entertainer ever,1
great songs!  After all it's Michael Jackson. Enough said. (now just filler words for something that Speaks For Itself. ),1
"This two CD set contains just about every MJ classic tune that you could possibly think of!!! Thriller,Beat It,Man In The Mirror,Smooth Criminal,Billie Jean...they are all on here. Plus so much more! This collection is a must for every MJ fan! Highly recommend!",1
"I've been a Jackson 5 fan all my life and Michael Jackson still reigns as King of Pop.  I first heard In the Closet when I saw the video on VH1 and loved it then.  When I saw it was available on kindle, I thought ""about time.""  A classic Michael song.  Perfection.  I only wish I could have downloaded the video to it as well.  Hey now, kindle, there's an idea!",1
"I finally decided to add 'The Essential Michael Jackson 3.0' set to my collection, and it's almost perfect. Unlike the original release, this one comes in a digipak fold out case, which hold the 3 CDs in slits and can be a problem if you handle them often, so plan on uploading the music to iTunes (etc) to avoid scratching your discs. The digipak case unfolds to reveal cool photos of Michael, and you also get a nice booklet that provides more photos, plus complete details (chart info, etc) for each song. As for the music, this collection does a nice job representing BOTH the Motown & Epic years for Michael (and his Brothers on Disc 1). The first 2 CDs are jam packed with a total of 38 songs, many of which are featured as 'single edits', which is fine as I already have the full versions. The Bonus 3rd Disc is a nice treat, but could've been perfect if 'I'll Be There', 'Dancing Machine', and 'Scream' (Duet with Janet) were included. It does however feature Michael's #1 duet with Paul McCartney ('Say, Say, Say'), which has never appeared on a Jackson CD until now. At any rate, I recommend this affordable 3 CD set to fans who want a better Michael Jackson collection than 'Number Ones' or aren't ready to purchase the 'Ultimate Collection' (which also failed to include a number of classics!).",1
"38 songs of Michael Jackson's top songs! wow, can't beat that for this price. I'm very happy with this purchase.",1
"we usually listen good music when driving somewhere, usually a road trip will take 2 to 4 hours. we like Michael Jackson's music and is never boring or annoying at all. sound quality is great as well.",1
Good luck finding any artist or group putting every song hit on one cd - it just doesn't happen. But if you want to buy a Cd with a lot of Michael's hits- you cannot go wrong with this selection. Pricing was very fair.,1
i have nothing bad to say about this product.  It works well and i use it everyday. nice and easylove,1
I was a bit late in becomming a fan of Mr. Jackson (unfortunately!) so I'm trying to catch up on his works. Hopefully I'll find more CDs to add to my collection; this CD is a great start. I definitely recommend this to other fans--existing ones as well as new ones like myself.,1
"I've purchased this album in iTunes and again through Amazon because this album has so many of Michael Jackson's awesome works, it's a great one shot deal. Some of the songs here I never (or may have been too young) remembered like, ""Ben."" Michael Jackson is great house cleaning or sitting in traffic music.",1
"There's no denying the impact Michael Jackson has had on popular music over the course of forty years. From the Jackson 5's first No. 1 (""I want you back"" when Michael was eleven) through his untimely death at the age of fifty.  I was still in high school when Michael and his brothers released four consecutive No. 1s (something not even the Beatles did). Despite Michael's popularity, I remained essentially a casual fan. I didn't buy a Michael Jackson album until THRILLER--an album that spawned seven hit singles and has sold over 100 million copies to date.  I eventually bought 1995's HIStory and later 2001's GREATEST HITS. But if you're looking for one collection to hit all the highlights of a brilliant career (I bought mine as a Black Friday deal), this is everything the casual fan needs:  solo hits starting with 1971's ""Got To Be There"" through 1999's ""You Rock My World"" along with a sprinkling of Jackson 5/Jacksons hits. [The only glaring omissions are the duets with his sister Janet (""Scream"") and Paul McCartney (""Say Say Say"")]  Overall, this is two and a half hours of music that changed the landscape of popular music forever. This music belongs in any serious collector's library. ESSENTIAL  [Running time - Disc 1, 78:56; Disc 2, 78:50]",1
"The title says it all. It has all the classics and popular MJ Hits 2CD pack, a must have for everyones collection.",1
"It's no secret that Michael Jackson was incredibly talented and gifted musician, the fact that he also had a passion for his art must have helped. This two discs collection covering the man's entire career from the time he was a little kid up to his later years as one of the most famous person on this planet. It serves as an example of how great his music was and how it's still amazing today. Few artists have had the impact that MJ had on the music industry, Michael revolutionized it, and in the 1980's Michael was fashion. MJ's certainly has an interesting musical career and The Essential Michael Jackson is all the proof you need, we could go into how Thriller is the best selling album of all time, or how History is the best selling double disc album of all time, or how Blood On The Dance Floor is the best selling remix album... However the point here is not to demonstrate Michael's numerous accomplishments in the music industry, it's how good his music was.  The first 8 songs of this greatest hits album are from Michael's time in the Jackson 5/ Jacksons. Then we get 4 songs from Off The Wall (1979), 7 songs from Thriller (1982), 8 from Bad (1987), 7 from Dangerous (1992) and 1 from both History (1995) and Invincible (2001). All the hits you would expect are here: Don't Stop `Till You Get Enough, Billie Jean, Thriller, Bad and much more. There isn't much to say about the songs included, they're all great in their own way and deserving to be on this ""essential"" collection. Besides the ""Ultimate Collection"" boxed set, this compilation is by far the most comprehensive look at Michael's career. It covers not only his solo career but his early years as a child with the Jackson 5/ Jacksons which is a nice feature of this compilation disc, Michael Jackson compilations tend to be focused only on his solo career.  I can't hide the fact that I'm a little disappointed that there is only one song from both History and Invincible. Those latter years album were not huge hits for Michael (although History sold very well and went on to become the most successful double disc album of all time) but I still like them both and thought more songs from these albums could/should have been included. ""They Don't Care About Us"" and ""Earth Song"" are excellent songs from History that would have been excellent to have on a career-spawning collection. From Invincible I think ""Whatever Happens"" should have been here and perhaps ""Butterflies"". It's easy to understand why almost nothing from these albums was included, they do not really match the pop ""hits"" in terms of lyrics or musicality, they are much more personal and less accessible than material from Thriller or Bad for instance. That aside, The Essential Michael Jackson gives buyers what they really want, the hits and more well-known songs. I must add it does a good job at doing so!  The Essential Michael Jackson does an excellent job of going further than your average compilation and offers Michael's hits and some of his best songs. The fact that it covers his entire career is great; you get a proper overview of Jackson's music. For someone who is relatively new to Michael Jackson's music this is really The Essential Michael Jackson.  4  /5.",1
"While it has been six months since the tragic and heartbreaking death of Michael Jackson, many people have recently rediscovered what had made him such a strong and influential singer, and the icon he was. Not the jokes he was labeled that dogged him through the past several years. Nevertheless, it has been quite easy to forget in any such way why he was recognized as the ""King of Pop"". Yet, there have been several different greatest hits collections that have showcased why Michael Jackson was so assertive, and pushing the envelope each and everytime. Back in 2005, at the time he was acquitted of the well-publicized child molestation charges, Sony released The Essential Michael Jackson through the heartbreak he endured. Well, earlier this past year, before his death it was re-released and nicely expanded to its 3.0 series. Here is the result.  The Essential Michael Jackson 3.0 expands what made The Essential Michael Jackson a strong re-introduction to his music to a whole new generation. But, overall 3.0 handles it a bit better by adding some of the overlooked tracks that showed why Michael was a icon. The songs here have all been remastered well, as the collection showcases from each of Michael incarnations with his brothers through The Jackson 5, The Jacksons, and his solo efforts. The collection includes a lot of his great and distictive tracks from I Want You Back, the understated Enjoy Yourself, as well as gems from his solo smashes from Thriller, Got To Be There, Rock With You, Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough, as well as Man In The Mirror, to his final major hit, 2001's You Rock My World. The extra disc also expands mostly well, by including some of Michael's tracks that were sadly overshadowed like Say, Say, Say with Paul McCartney, the deep They Don't Care About Us, and the intimate Stranger In Moscow. Yet, with all the hits from the collection, there were a few tracks that were sadly overlooked like Scream, his duet with his sister Janet Jackson, Gone Too Soon (which its video showed the beloved chile Ryan White whom embattled AIDS), and other songs like Childhood and Earth Song.  Overall, despite a few overshadowed songs, The Essential Michael Jackson 3.0 is a strong and simple greatest hits album for anyone whom has yet to own a Michael Jackson record, and wants to remeber why he was so special and enduring to the music industry. If you have not yet owned a Michael Jackson record, this honestly would be a great place to start for your listening pleasure. R.I.P. Michael, you've rocked the world, and so many hearts along the way.  Album Cover: B  Songs: B 1/2+  Price: B+  Remastering: B+  Overall: B 1/2+",1
"All the Essential CD's are fantastic. Heart,Barry Manilow,and alot of artist have the Essential collections at Target for 9.99. This Michael Jackson collection is also great. All the hits are here from the Jackson 5 years,and Michaels hits,including his last,""You Rock my World.""",1
"Michael Jackson gave us so much wonderful music during his lifetime; and this two CD set showcases his fine talent. Michael is consistently at the top of his game on these tracks; there's not a dud in the bunch. The quality of the sound on these two CDs is excellent and I like the artwork as well.  ""I Want You Back"" starts the first CD off with Michael doing a great job with the rest of The Jackson 5; they sing and play this to perfection--and beyond! ""ABC"" is very catchy. ""Got To Be There"" is a very romantic song that is truly a classic; Michael's genius is clearly abundant even at a very early age. He sings ""Got To Be There"" with all his heart and soul; and he never lets go of a single superfluous note, either! ""Rockin' Robin"" is infectiously catchy and upbeat, too--and how's about that guitar solo?  ""Ben"" is a masterpiece even if Michael is singing a song about a pet rat (!!!); Michael's excellent diction makes ""Ben"" even more beautiful. ""Enjoy Yourself"" again has Michael with the rest performing just wonderfully; and it's got that `70s beat I always like so much. ""Blame It on the Boogie"" is still perfect for dancing nearly wherever you are; and there's yet another gem in ""Shake Your Body (Down To the Ground)."" Listen also for Michael to deliver ""Don't Stop 'Til You Get Enough"" without ever skipping a beat; and he does outstanding work as he sings ""Rock with You;"" ""Off The Wall"" and a great duet with Paul McCartney entitled ""The Girl Is Mine."" ""Billie Jean"" was a huge hit for Michael when it was released; and it remains one of his best tunes ever. It's got some beat! ""Beat It"" is yet another jewel on the first CD. ""Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'"" is another catchy, infectious tune that sticks in your mind forever once you hear it; and I especially like ""Thriller;"" ""Thriller"" is timeless and just one listen proves it!  ""Bad"" is another awesome tune that features Michael squarely front and center; that music fits in perfectly with his vocals but wisely they never try to steal the show away from MJ--he stands right there, front and center where he belongs! ""I Just Can't Stop Loving You"" gets a most sensitive treatment from Michael and Siedah Garrett; and ""The Way You Make Me Feel"" is pop music at its very best. ""Man in the Mirror"" is a meaningful tune with a sensitive flavor to it; and Michael does a superb job on ""Another Part of Me."" I love it! ""Black or White"" is very well done; Michael sings this with lots of energy and it helps the number a lot. ""Heal The World"" is very sweet and easy on the ear--this music lacks nothing, it's all THAT good.  ""Remember The Time"" has an eerie sound to it that nevertheless sounds really good; it's truly more classic pop as only Michael could do it. ""Will You Be There"" uses a choir in the background for a nice effect; and ""Dangerous"" has some beat! ""You Are Not Alone"" is one of the most beautiful songs I've ever heard; no wonder why so many people love Michael Jackson's songs! The second CD ends well with MJ performing ""You Rock My World."" Awesome!  Michael Jackson fans should consider this a ""must-have"" for their collections; and it has so many songs that it makes the perfect introduction to MJ and his music for newcomers just discovering his magic. I highly recommend this two CD set.",1
"This CD is awesome and I have enjoyed it so much his music is so inspiring to me. He has talent no one else will ever possess and the music on the CD shows it. I am truly devastated over the loss of MJ I am still crying about it.  He will live in my heart forever.  I only wish the negative people would have known the real MJ. Listen to his words, look at his various videos on the web in regards to children, read the court transcripts and read the book on his conspiracy.  You will know why he was acquitted because he was totally innocent from day one and every juror knew it.  God Bless his beautiful children.  I am looking forward to the day his children are older and they give an interview on what a wonderful ""DADDY"" he was.",1
"This is the only Michael Jackson album you need to buy. It has all the essential hits/tracks spanning his entire career!  While he had tons of hits, all of his individual albums had songs that were not hits and not good songs. So, there is no need to buy the individual albums unless there is a particular song that is not on this 'essential' album that you are looking for.",1
"Outside the supernova explosions of the early Jackson 5, Michael Jackson's peak years were '80-'82 of Off The Wall and Thriller. In fact, Thriller and its breakthrough, extended-length video dominated mainstream popular music during its amazing chart run. Those years, also, however, hosted rebellions against that same mainstream, with punk and new wave bands continually storming the staid pavilions. A lot of people were fed up with corporate crap, top-down thinking and the pop band as commodity/tool. Michael Jackson was anything but staid, but he was of them. I mean, Quincy Jones! Industry creation though he was, Jackson synthesized the tension and energy around him to reach his creative zenith, plunging his music into the currency of sexual politics well-beyond the dance floor blatherings that typically decorate even genius killer grooves. He produced the toughest, most sophisticated work of his career in ""Billie Jean."" That song touched off a widespread national conversation about the dangers and responsibilites of sex. But as big as Thriller was, Michael Jackson never again displayed the confident, at-ease sexuality of Off the Wall and his hits were scarcely more beloved than the best of hitmakers Hall and Oates from that point on. The opening Jackson 5 bombs detonate here as if preparing you, and the big early 80's hits still deliver a huge amount of excitement. This holds well up into ""Bad,"" opening the second CD, then slowly unwinds until midway into the second disc it completely disappears under a showcase of embarassing schlock. And that includes the DOA dance floor misfire ""Dangerous,"" which does nothing to illuminate beat cues cribbed from Prince. The Essential Michael Jackson shows a tantalizing artist on a blazing short run, shaping the best dance grooves in the land into actual cohesive songs. I certainly love him yet its pretty obvious listening to this Essentials package that Jackson's place in the pantheon is cushioned with padding.",1
"Who would have ever thought Michael Jackson would die in this era?  It doesn't seem real, he wasn't supposed 2 die.  This collection of hits is almost as good as buying all of his solo works.  I actually would rather have each individual album but I don't have time for all that and I already own hundreds of cds, so The Essential Michael Jackson makes the most sense, for content and consolidation reasons.  But I still would like the artwork and other tracks from the other cds but I just don't feel like buying them, so i just bought this.  I went to 5 different stores and they were all SOLD OUT.  I finally got the last copy but I had to pay $25.  I think alot of people are just buying this cd as a trinket, I actually want to LISTEN to the music, so stop buying it if you are just going to hold it in your hand and stare at it and drool over it.  As for the music, I don't like any of the Jackson 5 stuff, it sounds dated and all the songs are overplayed.  I like ""Ben"", in my oppinion, that's the only good song MJ did when he was really young. They left out ""Never can Say Goodbye"" which is about the only good Jackson 5 song, so that sucked.  All MJ's other hits are on here from ALL the albums.  The only other song I'm pissed about is ""Jam"".  I wish they would have included that song, but I don't want to have to go out and find a copy of ""Dangerous"" just for that song.  Life is complicated and the music industry always makes it complicated for music fans. I wasn't really impressed with the pics in the liner notes, they could have included better, unreleased pics of Michael.  I am a Michael Jackson fan even though I disconnected with him and his music during the child molestation stuff.  Now that he died, I can feel better about paying him tribute and listening to his music again.  After all, I did a lip sync of ""Bad"" in full costume in high school drama class.  MJ was a part of my life.  God Bless u Michael, this world loved u.  *One last note....""Farewell My Summer Love"" should have been included on this cd, that song is probably impossilble to find.  I used to have it on 45.",1
"Even though Michael Jackson's personal life was rocked with scandal and I didn't always approve of his antics but I cannot ignore the cultural impact this gifted performer had on me as a child. I was in born in 1982, I remember hearing him on the radio and thought wow what a voice! The song was Dirty Diana from his Bad album. It wasn't until 1991 when his Dangerous album was released that I became a fan of Jackson, Black or White was a stellar video and the cd was just pure pop candy, I ate it up! After the scandal broke in 1993, I lost interest in Jackson but now that he is no longer with us - I hope will be remembered for his music and dancing ability - he was one-of-a-kind. This collection of greatest hits is spectacular! There are couple of Jackson 5 classics and of course the best tracks of his career like Thriller, Billie Jean, Human Nature, The Man in the Mirror, In the Closet, Shake Your Body (Down to the Ground), She's Out of My Life, Will You Be There?, and Don't Stop Til You Get Enough. He changed the sound and look of pop music forever, RIP Michael!",1
"Thjere are many Michael Jackson CD's on the market. This is the one to own however since it captures all of his big hits and well represents my two favorite albums ""Off The Wall"" and ""Thriller"". His best songs are all here"" Rock With You, Don't Stop Til You Get Enough, Beat It, Billie Jean,The Girl Is Mine, Human Nature, etc. as well as his early hits with the Jackson Five and the great later albums like ""Bad"" and ""Dangerous"". THIS IS THE BEST SOUNDING representation of these hits I have ever heard. There are 37 cuts. Michael was indeed an American tragedy and a pop music icon. If you can only own one CD, this is the most logical choice. My only quibble is the omission of ""Never Can Say Goodbye"" which was my favorite Jackson Five song. At one time, he was selling over one million albums-CD's a day (1983-84). He changed the course of pop music history and his legacy will live on despite the cynics. Highly recommended!",1
"In 2005, Sony released without much or any fanfare the terrific ""Essential Michael Jackson"", which easily is the best Michael Jackson compilation available these days. It also released a slightly different international version, which I recently picked up while in China. No, I didn't buy it from a pirated-CD hawking character on some street corner. In fact I bought it in a regular CD store in Shanghai, for all of 39 RMB (about US$ 5.50), if you can believe that.  The international version of ""The Essential Michael Jackson"" (2 CDs, 38 tracks, 156 min.) differs only slightly from the US version:  1. The Jacksons' ""Can You Feel It"" replaces ""Enjoy Yourself"" (an improvement); 2. Somehow ""I Just Can't Stop Loving You"" (from ""Bad"") is lumped along with (and in the middle of) the ""Thriller"" songs on CD1, obviously not an improvement; 3. The title track from ""Dangerous"" is left off, and instead 2 tracks from 1995's ""HIStory"" second CD of new material are added (""Earth Song"" and ""They Don't Care About Us""), a wash as far as I'm concerned although ""Earth Song"" remains a greatly underappreciated tune. How ""They Don't Care About Us"" ended up on the ""essential"" list, is a head-scratcher (although I like the song).  Would I have bought this again if it wasn't for the ridiculous low price in China? Almost certainly not. But I am glad I did, if nothing else, because it is just another memento from my trip to China (the Chinese version comes with Mandarin characters on the cover). That aside, ""The Essential Michael Jackson"" is a terrific album, whether you buy the US version or the international version, and it really showcases Michael Jackson at his best.",1
"Michael Jackson is a timeless Musical Genius. He Owned the Last Century. Dick clark got it right  when he gave MJ the Award as Artist of the Last century. nobody before or since captured the whole World's Musical  Complete Attention as the soul Brother from  the Dirty of Gary Indiana. these songs showcases His Greatness for  Decades upon Decades. His Vocal Range&ability to adapt to Musical changes highlights a Genius without Limits.  Michael Jackson is the ""DON OF MUSIC"" period. Michael back in the day was a Event all unto Himself.  there aren't too many artists who cover as much Ground as MJ past or Present.  He changed the game of Popular Music.  these songs made me go and get Penny Loafers and get my dance on.  these Songs reprensent a wonderful time in Music.  without Michael Jackson I wouldn't even really care about Music. he was that Cat that Made a Brother truly appreciate the Art form to the Highest form.",1
"Isn't this unbelievable? Another Michael Jackson compilation! Many of Jackson's fans own HISTORY-PAST PRESENT AND FUTURE BOOK I,NUMBER ONES and the ultimate 4 disc(3 CD and 1 DVD) compilation. This collection,like the latter aforementioned one,features many of Jackson's all-time hits(his solo recordings,Jackson 5 recordings and Jacksons recordings). So put these CD's in your player,turn up the volume and get down and funky! You'll be glad you did!",1
"Michael Jackson is the biggest selling artist of all time. Also one of the greatest artists of all time. This is the 3rd greatest hits album in row. First in 2003, we get the Number Ones album, then in 2004 we get the Ultimate Box Set Edition,& now this. Don't get me wrong, I love Michael Jackson but why no new material on this album. The first Disc starts off great, the only missing from that one is songs like the Jackson 5's I'll Be There,Lovely One,Heartbreak Hotel,Never Can Say Goodbye and a few more. But that is why they released the Essential Jacksons. Disc 1 continues into all the ""Off The Wall"" & ""Thriller"" classics. Starting on Disc 2, it goes into all the ""Bad"" singles..the only one that was missing is ""Liberian Girl"" which was a single in the U.K., All the singles from ""Dangerous"" are here besides ""Jam"". I am not sure why the title cut ""Dangerous"" included. That should of been where ""Jam"" should of been. Also the final single from the ""Dangerous"" album is not included ""Gone Too Soon"". Now it starts to slip a little. We only get 1 song ""History"" & One song from ""Invincible""? No No!! Where is Scream, They Don't Care About Us, Stranger In Moscow,Earth Song & Childhood? From Invincible, where is Cry & Butterflies? and also his 2003 hit single ""One More Chance""? All of these titles are missing. Hopefully we will get a new album from him soon and not anymore greatest hits album.",1
"This is just as strong and vibrant as the box set that came 8 months before it! I sent a copy of it to my uncle in Georgia a few days after it came out on July 12! Sony made a smart move to release this after Michael Jackson was declared innocent.  This one, like the box set, combines his Jackson 5 hits, his Jacksons hits and his solo hits going up to 2001.  Past albums stopped at Thriller, but this goes even further to Invincible.  But my favorites are on here, from Got To Be There, I Want You Back, Shake Your Body, Blame It On The Boogie, Off The Wall, Beat It, Billie Jean, In The Closet, Remember The Time, Another Part Of Me, Bad, Dirty Diana(the hummable song), Smooth Criminal, Dangerous, and You Rock My World. The sound's a little loud, but I think they wanted a full, complete listening experience to the listener.  The packaging said 37 songs, but there are 38 songs here, and what a spectacular collection of Michael's hits. I know there are people saying, ""But why isn't Butterflies or State Of Shock on here?""  It must have been tough deciding what to put on here, because Michael has always made quality music.  To Usher, Justin Timberlake, Omarion and the top singers/dancers, you are all great artists, but you need 20 more years or so in the business to catch up to the greatness and artistry of Michael Jackson! Keep working at it! I could play these CDs all night long because all my favorites are on here! Can you hear those funky beats and rhythms in the distance when you hear this album going down an interstate for 100-170 miles or so on a road trip?  This is yet another great compilation album of Michael's hits, probably better than 2003's Number Ones. Get multiple copies to send to your family members and friends!",1
"Truth is, Michael Jackson needed a 2-disc collection as much as anybody. Those single discs didn't quite do it for somebody who's still often called the ""King Of Pop"". So, the pros and cons. I personally don't need the Jackson 5 material myself, but some might. I also think this is a bit shy on his most recent work. I do miss ""Earth Song"" and the duet ""Scream"" with Janet too. However, many of his best songs came from ""Thriller"" and ""Bad"", and we get most of those here. In fact there are 7 of the 9 songs from the original ""Thriller"" album, and even more from ""Bad"". Plus we get the best of ""Off The Wall"", and again some of his earliest stuff. The fact is, after listening to this collection of Michael Jackson, you almost can't not like him. It's just ""Human Nature"".",1
"Despite all the controversy that has occured with Michael Jackson, he is truly the king of pop and he truly has one of the best recording voices ever.  You can't deny that Michael Jackson is one of the most influential artists not only in pop, but also in the Twentieth Century of music itself.  THRILLER has sold millions and millions of records and continues to sell and stand the test of time.  This collaboration is one of the most complete MJ collaborations that I have seen.  This one not only contains Jackson's solo career but also contains his work with the Jackson 5.  Unfortunately, maybe this should've been a 3 disc set, because there are a few of his most notable hits missing including ""I'll Be There"", a standard song in Jackson's arsenal.  Otherwise, it is probably the most complete compilation that you will find for MJ.  It is wonderful reliving hits such as ""I Want You Back"", ""Billie Jean"", ""Thriller"", ""Wanna Be Startin' Something"", ""Don't Stop Til You Get Enough"", and etc... 4 stars.",1
"When I saw that Sony had made Michael Jackson the latest artist to be anthologized in their ""The Essential..."" series, I really was surprised to be honest, since the series never actually covers of this magnitude. I am compelled to say that they only compiled this collection because they wanted to cash in on the revived interest in his music after his ""not guilty"" verdict.  If this is indeed, the case, then it shouldn't really matter, since the two disc ""The Essential Michael Jackson"" is actually an affordabel and, for the mosr part, comprehensive collection for a person who only wants to own one Michael Jackson cd. Now, I do not have this cd. I already own the four disc boxed set and ""Thriller"" (all a fan needs, really), but I already own must of the songs, so I feel that I am qualified to write a review for it.  If you're the casual Jackson fan, you pretty much get all the stuff you need: the Jackson 5 hits (though ""I'll Be There"" and ""Dancing Machine"" are strangely omitted), early solo hits, later Jacksons recoridngs, and all the hits from his trifecta of best selling albums: ""Off The Wall"", ""Thriller"", ""Bad"" and ""Dangerous"". The hits from those album make up well over half the collection. You will also get two post 1992 recordings, the 1995 megahit ""You Are Not Alone"" and the 2001 Top Ten single ""You Rock My World"".  As with most if not all entries in the ""Essential"" series (as with most compilations), there are some problems. Judging by how many songs are on each discs, some tracks are bound to be edited. Most of these songs are the single versions that we're used to hearing, so we shouldn't really be bothered buy this, except that ""Thriller"" loses its magic without the long intro of the footsteps approaching the door, etc. Also, there are some tracks left off, such as ""I'll Be There"", ""I Wanna Be Where You Are"", ""Dancing Machine"", ""Ease On Down The Road"", the Paul McCartney ""Say, Say, Say"" (the only one of Michael's solo number ones to be omitted, though it may be because it was originally released on a Paul McCartney solo album rather than one of Michael's), ""State Of Shock"" (The Jacksons' collaboration with Mick Jagger) and the Janet Jackson duet scream. However as a whole, this collection will not disappoint, and is highly recommended for casual fans.",1
"...But not so because of it's lack of completion. As in the past Greatest Hits compilations by Michael and The Jacksons, there has always been filler...but no thriller, hits with pits! So this compilation IS the best so far!! Pictures included are his best photos showing off a talented singer/songwriter and not the everchanging cosmetic mess. The quality of the mastering is far superior than previous compilations including that of the earlier hits from Motown...like I Want You Back, ABC and Got To Be There. The track information is informative and I don't recall another compilation that has such details.    But the reason for the 1 less star is that it did not complete the Essential and added 2 songs that were not Essential for this type of CD. Granted he has had more #1 hits and more top 40 hits than most!! Over 4 decades here, from 1970 - 2000!  But where is the # 1 Essential I'll Be There or Dancing Machine?  They could have left out Dangerous which never charted and Leave Me Alone which is an essential, but not a hit as well. The video was a bigger hit!    OK now what's next?  Maybe Volume 2 Essential ...and!",1
"Whoa!!!!! Where did this come from? Without any hype or media attention, Sony has just released ""The Essential Michael Jackson"" (37 tracks, 157 min.), perhaps the ultimate Michael Jackson compilation.  CD 1 (20 tracks, 79 min.) cover the period up to and including the ""Thriller"" album, starting with the best known Jackson 5 singles such as ""ABC"" and ""I Want You Back"", then shifting to the Jacksons. It would have been better to include ""State of Shock"" or ""Lovely One"" instead of ""Enjoy Yourself"". CD1 finishes off with 7 of the 9 ""Thriller"" album tracks (the other 2 being ""Baby Be Mine"" and ""The Lady in My Life""; it's still hard to believe how successfull that album really was, and how many hits were relased from it, in the days when ""radio tracks"" meant actual vinyl single releases). This was of course Michael at his absolute best, now 23 years ago.  CD2 (17 tracks, 78 min.) compiles 8 tracks from ""Bad"" and 7 from ""Dangerous"", and finishes off with ""You Are Not Alone"" from HIStory and ""You Rock My World"" from Invincible. In other words: only 2 tunes from the post-1992 era, and rightfully so, even though the HIStory and Invincible albums are not nearly as bad or mediocre as many would like you to believe. The only track that arguably should be on here (but, at 78 min. already, at the expense of what other track then?) is ""Scream"", the No. 1 duet with sister Janet.  In the end, this ""essential"" compilation is better than any other compilation available (HIStory Vol. 1; Number Ones, etc.) as it covers both the Jackson 5/Jacksons era and his solo output. It's very strange to me that this was released without any hype or advertizing campaign, but the main thing is that it's out and available. Hihgly recommended!",1
One of the best thrash albums from any band.  This whole record set a standard for others to try and reach.  Few would ever come close.,1
"These single disc remasters were done on the cheap end. They didn't even bother to paint the disc. The only thing telling you this is remastered is a little snippet in the booklet, which is basically just the cover, back, and a page with lyrics. It's all fairly pedestrian. I literally sent the first disc back because I thought it was the 80s disc. I cannot believe they went so cheap on these. It is literally almost impossible to tell this is a remastered disc.  The three disc Master of Puppets release is by far the best one for the affordable versions. The remaster here has some slight tweaking, but otherwise sounds nearly the same as the old disc. Dynamic range is still very good for metal. If you want to revisit these classics, these cheap editions are the way to do it. I just wish they had given the buyer any clue how to differentiate these besides the small snippet in the cheap booklet. Bare minimum quality digipack, but it is low cost I guess. I just expected some kind of decent booklet with this remaster.",1
"This album sounds great on vinyl, no crackling at all, the new Blackened Records pressing is great.",1
Who doesn't have ride the lighting? Sounds awesome remastered and the packaging is better than those jewel cases. Best 5 bucks you ever spent.,1
"For those wondering, this CD is indeed remastered. Both this album and Kill 'Em All (with April 2016 release dates) are remastered versions, not just simple reissues.  It sounds improved versus the original CD release, although not drastically so. Enjoy!",1
You'll love it after you get it but in the mean time check out rollingbaby.com for all your baby stroller info!,1
"Great stuff. I had the album years ago, and I wanted to get it on CD!",1
"I already had one of the finest versions of Ride the Lightning on CD as a basis for comparison. I hadn't been able to find many reviews on the new $18.99 vinyl.  I purchased this at B&N with a coupon in-store today, but will share with my Amazon brethren as I get 95% of my new vinyl here and love to add to the reviews that I myself greatly depend on.  I have decent mid-fi equipment, not really a reference system but certainly good enough to expose the quality of an inferior recording. 1978 Japanese Technics SL-220 with AT95e > TC750 > Yamaha RX-V377 > HD598 and the CD on the same RX and phones via Yamaha CDP-S300  I prefer the vinyl by a good margin, though the only fault I can find is the vocals are a little low in this mix. Record was dead flat (as in free of warps) drilled dead center, poly lined paper sleeve, lyrics sheet, download card. Before playing The record was cleaned with A.I. #6 via KABUSA EV-1. Very quiet background and dead silent between tracks, generous lead-in area and dead wax, I think the overall time is just a hair over 47:00.  It may be the most quiet metal record I own as far as background, and darn sure is the best for $18.99 or less. The record volume overall is a tad low but nothing that's not easily overcome by the volume control. I was impressed to the point that I will now seek out the new releases of Kill em All and Puppets, despite Puppets having some issues according to reviews.  So yeah, mix sounds nice and balanced, good bass, vocals recessed a tad, but not a big deal IMO. Very happy with the price/quality. Would recommend. Kill EM All is my favorite Thrash era Metallica and this album bridges the gab between that album and puppets.",1
Since Amazon has lumped the Elektra CD release of this album i must specify which release i am reviewing. I am reviewing the 2000 24 karat Gold CD edition of Ride the Lightening remastered by Steve Hoffman. This is a Mobile Fidelity Sound Lab release just so people know. I own a few of their Miles Davis LP's remasters which sound amazing. Now back on track i have owned and played the hell out of Ride the Lightening (1995) CD put out by Elektra. While that version sounds good the 2000 Hoffman remaster blows any other CD edition out of the water. The album just has more life organic sound and does not sound harsh or filtered. The source material Mr. Hoffman worked on this release with was the original master tapes of the album. While the 1995 CD edition of RTL does not sound much different from the original vinyl version it did go through digital filtering possibly noise reduction and a few other things.  My reason for buying this version was i had heard Metallica had remastered Ride the Lightening again and were releasing a box set for the album. After hearing the sound on the album in that box had fallen victim to the loudness war i searched for an alternative. Snagging a decently priced copy of this long out of print remaster was luck on my part. All i have to say is if you care about sound stay far away from the RTL (2016 box set) it has nice extras which are tempting but yeah this 2000 MFSL Steve Hoffman remaster is the way to go. Best sounding version of RTL in my humble opinion.,1
"A true classic for metal fans, solid album with no clunkers",1
"I think this one of their best albums.  The sound is incredible as a whole, but the bass work is awesome.  Another must have to add to the collection.  You won't be disappointed if you pick this up.",1
Just got it today-8/8/2015!! I love it!! Awesome!! Fantastic!! Amazon is like a Xmas Wonderland!! I will be doing all of my shopping here!! Great music store!! Great!! Amazon has everything you could ever imagine or want!! :o),1
This album is fantastic. The playing and attitude along with great lyrics make this one of their finest records just behind MOP and the Black album.,1
"Like with a handful of the albums I own in my now far larger CD collection, this album has been in my possession since I was about 14, so needless to say, I should have done this review a very long time ago. Straight to the point: I really have to say that this is my absolute favorite Metallica album of all time. As a perfect follow-up to ""Kill 'Em All"" the sophomore album ""Ride the Lighting"" marks a point in their career when they were in the prime of their quality brand of thrash metal, making a name for themselves as a band, and further rising to prominence in the '80s metal scene.  With a dark and eerie atmosphere, coupled with massive, thundering guitars, skull-crushing drums and raspy vocals, no metalhead in existence will be dissatisfied upon even the first listen, and will never want to skip over any songs. Every one of the songs on this album is a perfect illustration of what defined the true sound of Metallica and what made them such a great band. From the high-speed, neck-breaking insanity from songs such as ""Fight Fire With Fire,"" ""Trapped Under Ice"" & ""Creeping Death"" to the more steady, yet eerily menacing ""For Whom The Bell Tolls"" and ""Fade To Black,"" this is the type of metal album that will never fail to disappoint any true Metallica fan.  Honestly, there is so much more I could say about this album that other have said before, I could go on all day about it! This, my friends, is the TRUE Metallica in their prime, and the defining sound of revolutionary metal greatness as we know it. Sadly, this period of their career in which they valued their art and staying true to themselves as musicians would not last beyond the '80s. We all know how they started to care more about money and sold out to the mainstream by going in a more alternative direction, ultimately destroying their own legitimacy as a metal band (See my review of their self-titled ""Black Album""), but at least we still have this album, along with ""Kill 'Em All,"" ""Master Of Puppets,"" and ""...And Justice For All"" to remind us of how awesome of a band they used to be.  All in all, this is definitely one album that makes no sense not to own, if you consider yourself a true Metallica fan, or a true metalhead in general. Just buy this album already! You know you want to. HORNS UP!!! \M/\M/",1
"This is how Metallica was meant to be played and enjoyed: loud and clear! It's a great album, 4.5 stars.",1
"I recently got into Metallica, and so I'm obsessed with finding everything they have done. This is an older album, but it's amazing. I watched some documentaries about them and had no idea that they were an underground band which makes their success even cooler. Every song is great. The Call of Ktulu is insane. They are all extremely talented and this shows why people like their music so much.",1
I love this album!  I still have the original vinyl picture disk but wanted to add the CD to my collection.  In my very humble opinion this is their best album with Garage Days a close second.,1
"METALLICA create a THRASH masterpiece with RIDE THE LIGHTNING.....After their glorious debut KILL EN ALL, METALLICA refined their raw punk THRASH into something more meaningful...While KILL EN ALL is a hallucinated young raw THRASH petard, RIDE show a mature side in METALLICA, with introspective lyrics and even a powerful ballad(FADE TO BLACK)....well, in my opinion is a COMPLETE MASTERPIECE with gens like the title track, FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE, FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS and CREEPING DEATH!!!!!! WELL DONE, METALLICA!!!!!!!",1
"Ride the Lightning is another example of good metal music done by a great metal rock band.  The album itself is just like And Justice and All dealing with death in certain songs like Fade to Black, For Whom the Bell Tolls, and Creeping Death.  The album had a deep impact on me on many songs off the album because at the time I bought it I was dealing with thoughts of death and the Metallica music infulence my release threw my poems I wrote and really help me get threw a dark period in my life.  But the actual music has some amazing metal music within it and deep powerful lyrics in it.  So if your looking for some good thrash metal type music pick this album up and see how many songs off it you enjoy and maybe the album will help you threw a dark period your going threw just like it help me threw mine as I wrote my poems and other items I write.",1
"Sometimes you just need to blow off steam! And when I get tired of my boss at work or I can't find a date I like to rock and/or roll!  Metallica has been rocking the free world for big time and I am one of their most passionate fans. I love the way the guitars sound like a garbage truck going over the side of a cliff!  Sometimes, I'll be driving and I'll pull up to some ying-yang playing hip hop way too loud out of their Ford Focus and then I flip the switch on my stereo to ""Ride the Lightning"" and it blows their high school BS off the road!  If my parents let me I'm going to get a ""Freedom"" tattoo on my neck and one of Lars Ulrich's face on my right hand. That way, if my parents go out for the night it'll be me and Lars alone and there's not a court in the land that can stop us from doing ANYTHING we want.",1
"This is an awesome CD! From start to finish. I love the way the CD starts off with a slow guitar intro on Fight Fire With Fire,then all of a sudden it gets up in your face with hard metal! I love it. My favorite song on here is,Fade To Black,which is my favorite Metallica song of all time. But every song on this album rocks. Just a shame there is only eight tracks on here though. I wish there was a re-release of this,with bonus tracks,such as outtakes or something cool like that.",1
"Ride the Lightning is one of my favorite Metallica album. It presents a fast and harsh music and lyrics, respectively, similar to that style of Slayer. I often state that Ride the Lightning and Kill'em All are two progenitors of thrash and death metal albums.",1
"If you're new to Metallica, this and the follow up, Master Of Puppets, are the albums to get, if you're a metal fan anyways. these 2 are hands down their best.  For an, at the time, little known metal band, the production is really good. Everyone is in top form. James's vocals are a little higher than they'd be after this album, which adds to the charm of this album. The band was driven. they had some good material, partly thanks to Megadeth frontman Dave Mustaine. And they put together a flawless album worthy of every metal fan's attention.  Fight Fire With Fire 10/10 - starts off with an acoustic intro that fades out as the electric guitars fade in. All this to lead into possibly the fastest Metallica song ever. This is a perfect opener with great guitar work, and vocals. this is definitely in a long list of favorite songs by Metallica, which every song with lyrics on this album actually are on.  Ride The Lightning 9/10 is an upper mid tempo song with solid vocals and a nice riff in the verses. Plus a catchy chorus. Overall a very good song.  For Whom The Bell Tolls 10/10 might be my favorite Metallica song ever. Granted it has stiff competition, but it might be. This one has a nice groove to it. This one's still fairly heavy, but not as heavy as the past 2 songs. There are some good melodies, and the guitar playing is really good. I hate to give credit to Lars, but his drums really add power to this song.  Fade To Black 9/10 is the first Metallica ballad. It starts with an acoustic guitar with some electric leads. It doesn't really have a chorus, just a riff, instrumental based chorus, similar to what Black Sabbath did a lot. And it works fine. The first 2 verses are slow ballad acoustic style, then the song speeds up for the bridge and solo. Overall a very good song.  Trapped Under Ice 9/10 after a ballad, what do any good metal bands do? They come back with a fast paced thrasher, which is what they did here. This is the second fastest song on the album. The song has a nice pace to it, and is an overall fun listen.  Escape 9/10 is kind of the pop song of the album. Odd it gets no recognition. This is probably the catchiest song on the album. This one's similar pacing to Ride The Lightning. It has a really good chorus, and is yet another in a long list of great songs on here.  Creeping Death 10/10 is another contender for favorite Metallica song. It's a fairly fast paced thrasher with a great horus. It has some slower parts as well and is a great way to close out the album.  Then there's an instrumental which I won't rate because I'm not really into instrumentals. It's played just fine, so I'm sure for fans of them it'll do.  Overall if you're a metal fan new to Metallica, which would be surprising, this is a good place to start. You won't be disappointed.",1
"Ride the Lightning is a lot better in my opinion but both are still great albums. RTL has the best of early thrash/speed metal but it also has some progressive influences that would show more on their next 2 releases. Ride the Lightning has the perfect mix and it's a classic. The band matured also from their previous both musically and lyrically, it's a but darker than their first album. It's also their first album to feature Cliff Burton on bass in every track, replaced Ron McGovney which he was the original bassist. Dave Mustaine was fired in 1983 and formed Megadeth, former Exodus guitarist Kirk Hammet replaced him and RTL is their first to feature him on guitar. The band gets their line up together here. All of the songs are great but Creeping Death is my personal favorite.",1
"This is a piece of metal magic. All the songs are glorious one, all the songs are classics. Metallica really creates metal magic on Ride the Lightning. The lyrics are truly amazing and the sound is the finest thrash metal. If you like metal, you reeeeeeally have to listen to this absolutely classic.",1
"Metallica are truly one of the forces to be reckoned with in their genre of music whether you call it Metal, Heavy-Metal or Thrash is of little importance, they're one of the greats. While everyone has their own opinion of the band and what would become a lengthy career you absolutely cannot take away their achievements and the great music they have put out. Metallica already proved themselves to be a great band with their debut album Kill `Em All which has that early real raw and unpolished sound that makes it a fan favorite. 1984's Ride The Lightning expands on the formula of Kill `Em All and shows a bit more maturity, I mean the debut is great and it shows a lot talent it also shows a lot of anger from some seriously p***** off teenagers. You can see a certain progression, a development from the first album and they were becoming more and more the band that would release Master of Puppets. Ride is a dynamic and solid album all the way through, it also features tight musicianship and a lot of youthful aggression that's still very much present more than 25 years later.  The opening song ""Fight Fire With Fire"" with its gentle guitar opening gives the impression that it's going to be a slower and softer song than usual for Metallica. WRONG! It soon changes and suddenly becomes very fast, perhaps one of the fastest Metallica songs. Excellent track to begin an excellent album. The title track, Ride, remains to this day one of my favorite Metallica songs with its incredibly fast solos and powerful lyrics. ""For Whom The Bell Tolls"" has one of the most iconic intros in Metal, once again amazing lyrics by James (""take a look to the sky just before you die, it's the last time you will"", sounds nice doesn't it?). ""Fade to Black"" can almost be considered a ballad for the band, the lyrics are so personal and depressing yet the song is uplifting. It's a slower song for Metallica but it progressively gets heavier, the song has such a strong feel it's hard to overlook how great it is. In fact it's one of my favorite Metallica track to this day.""Trapped Under Ice"", ""Escape"" and ""Creeping Death"" are also very good songs that should not be ignored, those songs are excellent but have not often been played live.""The Call of Ktulu"" is an amazing 8+ minutes instrumental and a damn good one at that.  Ride The Lightning while not a concept album is mostly about the different types of death and ways of dying and it shows in the song titles (Ice, electrocution and others) making of Ride a dark record. Ride is also the last album on which Dave Mustaine receives credit; here he is credited on two tracks, the title track and the instrumental ""The Call of Ktulu"". James came up with some particularly great lyrics on Ride The Lightning as he usually does, but here it's really special. Ride has terrific guitar work courtesy of James Hetfield and Kirk Hammet, excellent bass from Cliff Burton and solid drumming from Lars Ulrich. It would be a mistake to overlook a classic album and an album that had a huge role and impact on the Thrash movement. These songs are classic Metal tracks and any hardcore fan of this type of music worth his salt knows all about them already.  Some prefer the early raw Metallica sound of Kill `Em All and some prefer the acclaimed Master of Puppets album. With respect to those two amazing alums, out of the three first Metallica albums I'll have to say that Ride The Lightning is my personal favorite out of the three and is probably the one I like best of all the albums the band has done. I love Master just as much as the next guy but it's been overplayed, some of the stuff here has been overplayed as well but to a lesser degree. As much as I love the rawness of Kill `Em All I think the band is better on Ride. Everyone is entitled to their own opinion and mine is that Ride The Lightning is an amazing Metallica album, it features deep lyrics, skillful guitar playing and is everything there is to like about the band to begin with. A total Metal album, I very much enjoy this ""Ride"" years later. 5/5 for this one, a masterpiece and a landmark of Thrash Metal and metal in general.",1
"When fans talk about Metallica, many of them refer to the first four albums as thrash classics, grouping them together as if they all feature the same style and fit into the same genre.  What I see many people fail to point out is that Ride the Lightning was just as huge a shift in sound and style from Kill `Em All as The Black Album was from And Justice For All.  When Metallica wrote Kill `Em All, thrash as a subgenre of heavy metal didn't exist yet.  They were influenced by speed metal bands like Venom and Motorhead, and produced a debut album where the musical traits of those bands were stamped clearly on just about every song.  Starting with Ride the Lightning, Metallica made a full shift to thrash, essentially defining the genre by making far more use of shredding riffs, melodic solos, and high-speed double bass drumming.  While James still utilized his scream on tracks like Trapped Under Ice, he employed a deeper overall tone and used a more gruff delivery.  You really don't hear many similarities to Kill `Em All musically; I mean, what songs from Ride the Lightning would sound right on that album?  In my opinion, none.  They  showed incredible progression and maturity from the wild, intense nature of Kill `Em All to the controlled powerhouse approach of Ride the Lightning.  The album itself is an easy five stars (bold statement, right?).  What metal fan doesn't know For Whom The Bell Tolls and Fade to Black by heart?  Crushing thrash songs like Fight Fire With Fire, the title track, Trapped Under Ice, and Creeping Death are relentlessly aggressive.  Escape highlights the melodic NWOBHM influence that was virtually non-existent on Kill `Em All.  The perennial favorite Metallica instrumental, The Call of Ktulu, rounds out one of the greatest metal albums of all time.  It has a sound completely distinct from their others, has some of the best songs in Metallica's catalog, and without question belongs in any collection of heavy music.",1
first of all if you don't know about Metallica you probably be very young. Just buy it for the beginning . All the songs are master-super-heavy metal songs. I remember how many times i have heard this album. Fade to blcak - For whom the bell tolls - Creeping Death - The call of Ktullu - and the other songs are just amazing . there is a strong feeling by hearing this songs .,1
"It seems like Metallica is turning into a band that you either love or hate as years go by. That's pretty sad, because the band is essentially one of the all-time great metal bands of all time. Some people will say that they're overrated. Well, I say that I still enjoy their music a whole lot. A majority of their albums are living proof that they can create powerful and haunting music. Ride The Lightning, the second album and the first without former member Dave Mustaine, is an all-around masterpiece. From beginning to end, it's pure brilliance. Songs like ""Fade to Black"" and ""Creeping Death"" are sure to please every Metallica fan out there. ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" is not only my personal favorite on the album, but also my personal favorite from the band themselves. It's five minutes of pure awesomeness. ""The Call of Ktulu"" is a 9-minute instrumental that may be boring to some, but I find the melodies and sounds to be completely engaging. In short, I won't describe what the songs mean or sound like, since I'm sure almost every reviewer on this page are Metallica fans. I'll just conclude by saying that Ride The Lightning is a great metal album.  Grade: 9.8/10",1
"I bought this album for the song ""For Whom The Bell Tolls"" after watching Zombieland several times and realizing this was one of the few Metallica albums I didn't have. Great addition to my Metallica collection.",1
"Ride the Lightning being Metallica's 2nd studio album and their 1984 release is truly an incredible album. The album has produced some of the best thrash metal that I have ever listened to. The songs that I especially like are ""For Whom The Bell Tolls "" and ""Fade To Black"". All the lyrics are included in the book along with some photos of the band. We also get a list over whom plays what. The album was met with rave reviews by the critics. Allmusic and Kerrang! both giving the album very high marks in their reviews. 5/5.",1
"Metallica's second album is nothing short of amazing, the riffs are amazing, the solo's are epic, the vox are stellar and the songs are second to none.  With classics like Ride The Lightning, For Whom The Bell Tolls, Trapped under Ice, Call of ktulu etc this album is a fine example of thrash at it's best.  Metallica's second best album mostly due once again to Mustaines amazing songs.",1
This is one of the best thrash metal albums ever and it's just raw and powerful totally recomend this to any old school metallica fan or any metal fan in general. But I can't put this ahead of Master Of Puppets.,1
"Talk of Metallica albums usually passes over ""Ride the Lightning""; you hear how great ""Master of Puppets"" is, the transition that was ""the black album"" and general disgust at ""St. Anger."" The truth is, without ""Ride the Lightning,"" we never would have seen any of the others.  ""Ride the Lightning"" was Metallica's sophomore album, and it represents a quantum leap forward over ""Kill 'Em All,"" setting the sound that has come to be known as ""Metallica"" to us. The songs are more refined, yet still feel as raw as those off its predecessor. While it would later be refined into ""Master of Puppets,"" arguably the greatest metal album ever, this album is still a masterpience, containing ""Fade to Black"" and ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" as well as the very-well-done instrumental track ""The Call of Ktulu.""  Definitely an essential pickup for a Metallica fan, and one of the first few albums you should buy if you're just getting into the band.",1
"Metallica's sophomore album, ""Ride The Lightning"" certainly showcases some interesting and classic thrashers. It's hard to imagine what the metal community nowadays would be like without gems like this album. It seems that this album seemed to be an overlooked one in Metallica's early catalogue, considering ""Kill 'Em All"" is generally considered the birth of thrash metal, ""Master of Puppets"" is regarded as Metallica's magnum opus, and ""...And Justice For All"" got Metallica some mainstream attention with the music video for ""One"". Regardless of whether or not ""Ride The Lightning"" is overlooked or not, it's still a classic that should be in every metalhead's collection. One interesting thing about this album is that while it still captured the raw power and fast energy of Metallica's debut, it seems to have a thicker, more polished, and at times, more epic sound. Don't get me wrong, though, I still think ""The Four Horsemen"" off their debut is one of the finest metal epics, but to get a full review of ""Ride The Lightning"", simply read on. ""Fight Fire With Fire"" starts things off with some classical acoustic guitar playing for a bit over half a minute. Suddenly, a crushing riff rips its way into your sound system at about a hundred miles an hour. The massive drums crash their ways in and you have a fast and furious headbanger about the evils of pollution and nuclear warfare. The singing is also very raw, with James singing a very staccato pattern, ""Do!...Un!...-to others!...As!...They've!...Done to you!"". Great way to start off the album. ""Ride The Lightning"", the six and a half minute epic title track starts off with some high-pitched guitar notes before going into a thrashy, Devil's Tritone riff. Some epic guitar soloing is featured in here, along with an interesting storyline that shows how the band is against capital punishment. ""For Whom The Bell Tolls"" is a progressive, five-minute classic with plenty of great guitar riffs that occupy the first two minutes of the song. The nastiest riff of them all is featured in the chorus, and some wild guitar playing closes this war song out. ""Fade To Black"" is a personal favorite of mine, one of the best songs on the album, and one of the very best songs Metallica's ever written. Some sad but beautiful acoustic guitar work opens with a lovely electric solo. Mournful but poetic lyrics occupy the verses, then comes a powerful chorus riff. More great guitar soloing fills the rest of the song out. ""Trapped Under Ice"" is another heavy song about struggle, featuring some dirty riffage and wild soloing that definitely makes itself worthy to be on the album. ""Escape"" is a more melodic, radio-friendly sounding song, but nonetheless a great track, as well. A bit shorter and a pretty cool song. ""Creeping Death"" is a song that defines thrash metal. This is an overall great song that you gotta hear. Its lyrics refer to the Seven Plagues in the story of Moses in the Bible, and the thrashing riffs pummel their way into your brain. And, as always, Kirk Hammett shows us why he's an amazing guitarist when he screeches out those awesome guitar solos. ""The Call of Ktulu"" is a nine-minute, progressive instrumental. A cool way to end the album, it has an odd but mesmerizing tone that features some mighty and powerful riffs and drums, alongside solos that give the song quite an epic tone. I personally prefer ""Orion"" off ""Master of Puppets"", but this song is definitely a great one, too. So as you can see, ""Ride The Lightning"" is undoubtedly a classic metal album. I've seen it ranked as being one of the top ten metal albums of all time, and when you give this a listen, you'll see why. All of the tracks are very strong, the songwriting's great, as are the singing, guitar-, bass-, and drum-playing. Get this, along with the other three Metallica releases in the '80s, and even ""The Black Album"" if you're interested. Overall, this is a very strong and solid album that I would recommend to all fans of thrash metal, and heavy metal in general. Good job to the 'tallica guys! Thanks for the time, and peace.",1
"This just gets better every year.fade to black, trapped under ice, just 2 reasons to have this cd.no metal fan in the world should be without this. This album was also themed in a way - all the songs are about ways of dying. Fight Fire With Fire - Nuclear War Ride The Lightning - Electrocution For Whom The Bell Tolls - On the battlefield Fade To Black - Suicide Trapped Under Ice - Drowning Escape - Difficult to explain, listen and make your mind up about it Creeping Death - Murder All these songs are classics with great big crunchy guitar riffs, thick, heavy drumming, powerful bass, and to top it off great lyrics.",1
"4 stars for what it is in the history of metal, 3 stars for how it now compares to what it was back in the day.  In short: when this came out, heads turned and then banged, hard. Seemed miraculously heavy at the time, but of course this looks like Romper Room now after bands like Carcass etc (none of whom do much for me after a ""tune"" or two). I love true heaviness, which comes (to my ears) from extreme tightness between the drummer, bassist (kickdrum and bass locked in tight over the riff, specifically) and guitars. Here we have one of the great heavy rhythm players and a fine metal drummer.  But Lars and James are only half of this band. Kirk is WAY overrated as a lead player, very prosaic and uninspired, miles from someone like Randy Rhoads. And man, after the decades of Cliff-worship, this album proves that legend is often myth. The bass playing here is merely average, truly. There are dozens of heavier and tighter bassists; Cliff may have been a party monster and added to the vibe that way but his playing is average. Geddy, Geezer, Harris, etc etc etc blow him off the map.    That said, there are some fast and furious highlights here, but frankly everything is so on top of or ahead of the beat that it gets wearing after a few tunes. About one minute into Bell Tolls is a highlight because everybody locks in but the guitars are finally a bit back in the pocket and everything gets much heavier and fatter due to that. That's why the Black album hit so hard: producer Rock knew how to make their groove much fatter and got them focusing on melody as well as heaviness. The Black is too poppy to be real metal but is good for what it is, as is this. But neither is as good as Puppets, which has their most intense moments.    This is a great thrash album, but that genre gets real old if you want music as well as power. But if power and release is all you want, this will do it for you. But if you really want that, go to the various (FREEEEE!!!) Metallica tape-trading sites and get the live shows from this and later periods; that's where the real heaviness lays. Funny that the best stuff is free, ain't it? Who says life is always unfair?",1
"Metallica is boldly and appropriately named as it's virtually impossible to have any meaningful discussion about the Heavy Metal genre without any mention being made about the vast impact that this band has made over the 80s and up to the mid 90s.  They lifted up the genre from mindless, juvenile topics of wild sex, drugs and fast cars to discussions about serious topics from the meaninglessness of war to environmental disasters and so forth.  What U2 did for pop/rock, Metallica did for Metal in blending intelligent topics with very, very good musicianship and hence making the genre more accessible to a much wider audience than ever before.  In doing so, they extended the life of Metal and ensured an audience at a time when people were more interested in synth-pop ala Eurythmics, Depeche Mode, Howard Jones etc.  Metal owes a great debt to this band for ensuring the endurance and evolution of the genre to what it is to this day.  This version of the 1984 album comes in a mini-lp replica sleeve (mlps) design which is very, very well executed and is one of the best that I've ever seen.  The gatefold sleeve is made from very good quality thick cardboard and assembled so well that you don't fear it coming apart easily once the glue starts to get old.  Also included is a 12 page booklet with all the lyrics in Japanese.  For the English ones you'll need a good magnifying glass to read it from the gatefold sleeve itself which very faithfully replicates the original lp design.  Unfortunately, the sound quality is the same as it was in the original release and hence has not been remastered.  Although good by 1980s standards, the quality is not as good as what we have become used to with all the releases that have been well remastered these days.  For this reason, although the content is very good, I cannot give this version 5 stars as it's hard to justify the value proposition here as you are effectively paying for the mlps design only if you already have the album.  I suppose if you don't already have this or if you are a big fan of well-designed and executed mlps sleeves then you may be tempted to cough up the mulah for this.  If the sound had been remastered and hence improved over the original cd, I would have no hesitation to give this the full 5 stars and to recommend that you part with your hard-earned dough for this.  With ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" and ""Fade To Black"" you are getting two of Metallica's best ever tracks here and again contentwise you can't fault this album but you'll have to decide if the overall value proposition of this version of the album is worthy of the upgrade.",1
"After the blistering debut Metallica delve further into their psyche, further into their songbook and further into their fiercely traditional yet updated NWOBHM muse. And it's a more difficult metal experience in general, the songs on the debut cutting with a sharper knife whereas the numbers here tend to pound through only after repeated hammering with a blunter instrument. Fight Fire With Fire is perhaps the most similar to the songs of the debut and is the perfectly thought out album opener.  After that however the differences start seeping in. Ride The Lightning itself clocks in at over six minutes and I'm not sure it needs it. For Whom the Bell Tolls redeems everything however with it's excellent musical and lyrical assault. The production values on this album seem a little dull, the production credit goes to Metallica and perhaps that's the reason why the album always sounded to me like it was blasting away at me from behind a closed door.  But the mental imagery the band were playing with on the debut is expanded on this release. The very essence of metal lies within the sinews of songs such as Trapped Under Ice, Creeping Death and the swirling robes of the apparition that is The Call of Ktulu. And the literary references are a nice touch. Speaking as someone who has regularly had to defend metal to his friends (hey, we've all been there), it's refreshing to be able to blow them out of the water with examples of both mindless metal mayhem AND the more educated aspects of it.  All up I would not recommend this for the total metal novice. There are other more accessable slabs of metal out there. But I would heartily recommend it to any casual fan of the band who wants to explore the earlier stuff. In fact I'd recommend that all hard rock and metal fans accumulate every album this band did from it's debut Kill `Em All through to the black album. If for no other reason than for a useful history lesson regarding the harder end of the music spectrum.",1
"Ride the Lightning is the one Metallica album that seriously has a lot of aggressive power and remains a classic to this day.  While I'm not particularly thrilled with a few moments here and there, overall it's much better than what many of the metal bands in the mid 80's were doing (with all their big hair, constant partying and chicks).  Metallica's music remains fresh and exciting all these years later.  This album was REALLY underrated back in the mid 80's.  People back then didn't know how to approach something with this much speed and punch.  Fight Fire With Fire- a plodding guitar riff, and the idea for an acoustic intro is ripped off from a couple old Black Sabbath tunes.  The verse melody is horrible but the chorus is decent.  Ride the Lightning- the best part of the song is the 15-second guitar intro.  I love that.  Great chorus as well that remains memorable no matter how many times it's played.  Great guitar solo as well.  Some parts of the solo remind me of the mid 70's Rainbow song called ""Light in the Black"".  For Whom the Bell Tolls- let's just call it the way it is- this is a classic metal track in the same way ""Iron Man"" is Black Sabbath's classic.  Fade to Black- a softer number that gradually builds into a much heavier and typical Metallica track.  It's not really a ballad.  It's a shame the verse melody has been copied time and time again by Metallica themselves as early as their Black Album in the early 90's.  The original idea was right here on this album.  The lyrics don't sound very emotionally honest though.  I like the second half of the song more even though parts of the guitar solo sound ripped off from Black Sabbath's ""Snowblind"".  Trapped Under Ice- flashy guitar playing that sounds like a leftover from the Kill 'em All album.  Not that that's a bad thing, mind you.  Escape- really good song, though the chorus sounds stuck in the 80's with that dated sound.  I like the way the verse melody chugs along.  Great lyrics by their standards too.  Creeping Death- another memorable heavy/speed metal track.  These guys were clearly more talented than most.  The guitar solo sure sounds like it was copied from a popular Scorpions song at the time.  Call of Ktulu- a very slow, rocking build up.  It's really good but 9 minutes might tire out some people.  You need to have at least one Metallica album in your collection, and none of them are better than this one.  Get it.",1
"RIDE THE LIGHTENING, Metallica's second album, is notable for its musical direction, combining thrash metal with more symphonic, and much more complex, songwriting than previously seen in metal music.  When Metallica recorded their debut,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kill-Em-All/dp/B000002H5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kill 'Em All</a>, the record was brutal, fast, and noholds barred.  The music barrels ahead, and there isn't nearly as many different instrumental subtetlies and flourishes that Metallica would later use to adorn their music with.  Instead, the focus was to play the music as loud, and as fast, as humanly possible.  They sounded rather like their contemporaries in drawing from the same overall musical milieu.  A lot of bands from NWOBHM (""New Wave of British Heavy Metal"") were covering a lot of the same territory, such as Black Sabbath, Diamond Head, Iron Maiden, Venom, Motorhead, early Def Leppard (think&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/On-Through-the-Night/dp/B000001F7R/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">On Through the Night</a>, their 1980 album, not their hair metal stuff), Saxon and other bands considered part of that movement..  Beginning with this record, and culminating in ... AND JUSTICE FOR ALL, Metallica changed their approach.  Still retaining the aggression and attitude of punk, mixed with the loud, bone-crunching amalgamation heavy metal sound popularized the major bands of NWOBHM then put in progressive songwriting that owes as much to classical music as pop or rock or traditional heavy metal, and you have a good idea of what RIDE THE LIGTHENING,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Master-of-Puppets/dp/B000002H33/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Master of Puppets</a>, and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/And-Justice-For-All/dp/B000002H6C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">...And Justice For All</a>&nbsp;sounds like.  Those three records are what I call their progressive metal trilogy; with each album their song writing got more complex and more symphonic.  As much as I like KILL `EM ALL, this is the album in which Metallica really comes into their own.  While KILL `EM ALL has some very strong songwriting, they don't display the same complexity and melodic integrity as they do on this record. All over we see Metallica opening their sound up.  ""Fire with Fire"": The soft intro to ""Battery"" from MASTER feels like a nod to the great acoustic intro to the opening track, ""Fire for Fire"".  After the mellow intro, the band kicks the song into high gear.  This shift is clear evidence the band is mastering different dynamics and integrating shifting tempos into a coherent song structure, and they're not just brutally fast like KILL `EM ALL.  ""Ride the Lightening"" is one of Metallica's more epic compositions.  Lyrically the song sets up themes of being powerless in a hostile situation, a theme Hetfield would often return too.  ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" deals with the futility of war, another theme the and would revisit on both MASTER and JUSTICE, and is titled after the Earnest Hemingway novel.  One of the band's more famous early songs.  The intro is pretty long, at over two minutes before Hetfield starts singing.  ""Fade to Black"" is notable as it is the first ballad ever commercially released by the band.  [Just because they were labeled sell outs during the load era doesn't mean it diddn't happen fore then.]  Those people who hate LOAD and RELOAD should take note that accusations that Metallica sold out first surfaced with this very song, due to how much of a departure this was for the band's clearly established sound.  Now, however, most fans and critics, as well as the band itself, considered this one of Metallica's great songs.  The song is very much a study in dynamics, and while it is primarily a slower ballad, Metallica works in some heavy passages in the song as well.  The song deals mainly with death, and is considered a ""suicide classic"".  This is one of Metallica's most important songs, as it showed the band's fan base there was a lot more to the band than just mind numbingly fast thrash.  ""Trapped Under Ice"" has some killer chorus work and interesting lyrics.  Musically it's very solid as well.  The song has some absolutely intense guitar work.  Probably the second weakest song though, next to ""Escape.""  Metallica has only performed the song four times live.  ""Escape"" is one of the few songs the band has never played live.  Written as filler because they didn't have enough songs for the album, the band has pretty much disavowed the song.  While I don't know why the band hates it that much, it is true that this is easily the weakest song on the entire album, though not necessarily bad par se.  It's just the other songs are that good.  ""Creeping Death"", written from the point of view of the angel of death coming to kill all the first born in Egypt, remains one of the band's principal early epics, and is still one of their most frequently played songs.  Drawing their inspiration from the movie THE TEND COMMANDMENTS, Cliff Burton made the observation that the plague of the first born was like creeping death, and the band wanted to use it for a title they liked it so much.  One of the band's most famous of their early songs, this one's an undeniable thrash classic.  And last, but definitely not least, is ""The Call of Ktula"".  The second instrumental released by the band (after Anethestia, Pulling Teeth from KILL `EM ALL), this is the last song primarily written by David Mustaine of Megadeath fame that Metallica would record. Originally entitled ""When Hell Freezes Over"", Cliff Burton had the song renamed, because he was a H. P. Lovecraft fan and was referencing THE CALL OF CTHULHU.  Megadeath actually uses the chords for their song ""Hanger 18"". Discounting the two covers ""Tuesday's Gone"" and ""Mercyful Fate"" it's the band's fourth longest recording, and the longest song on RIDE THE LIGHTENING.  For my money, this is one of my favorite Metallica songs, and when I really started listening to this album in the late 1990s, this was the song I would play over and over.  It's much better than MASTER's instrumental ""Orion"".  Absolutely brilliant, even if Mustaine did write it.  Overall, this is the album that would set Metallica on the artistic path they would follow for the rest of the 1980s.  This is the album they became truly progressive.  If it weren't for ""Escape"", this could arguably be one of their top albums; as it stands, this is still one of Metallica's best records, just only slightly flawed for the inclusion of ""Escape"".  And it's important that while hair metal and spandex were giving metal a bad name, bands like Metallica and Iron Maiden were still keeping the hardcore music close to its roots.  Hair metal and glam/pop is rather dated.  It's too Metallica's credit that their albums stand up as well as they do and aren't dated at all, given they were, recorded in that same era of Def Leppard, Poison (damn Brett Michaels), Ratt, Slaughter, Warrant, Stryper, Europe, Journey, and other rather ridiculous bands were doing commercial hair metal and power ballads.",1
"This is only Metallica's 2nd album, but already they were turning into a great, ""thinking man's"" heavy metal.  Sometimes I like to think this is Metallica's debut, because this is really the first album where they became Metallica.  Many early fans bemoan Metallica's later albums, wanting them to return to the days of thrash metal with Kill 'Em All (their weakest album in my opinion).  They say they sold out by using slower tempos and multi instrumentation (like pedal steel guitars and hurdy-gurdy).  The reality is that Metallica has always been ambitious, and here on their 2nd album, they prove in conclusively.  This is a fantastic album, one that has really stood the test of time (it was made over 20 years ago, and still sounds fresh today).  It is loaded with classic Metallica tracks.  The thrash opener Fight Fire with Fire, the fantastic title track, the brilliant For Whom the Bell Tolls, the magisterial, signature track Fade to Black, another majestic, signature track in Creeping Death (one of my all time favorites), and the brilliant, prog influenced instrumental that closes the album, The Call of Ktulu.  It is also interesting to note that Kirk Hammett has a much larger role on this album.  He co-wrote many of the songs, and his lead guitar doesn't seem thrown in like it did on Kill 'Em All.  This is one of my favorite Metallica albums.  It's the 2nd step in a discography that just keeps getting better.",1
"Metallica's second album, and their first for a major record label Elektra, entitled Ride the Lightning is also arguably their best album ever. First released in August of 1984, Ride the Lightning was considered a metal masterpiece in the underground at the time of its release. After the promising debut album Kill 'em All in 1983, Metallica (which was comprised of singer/guitarist James Hetfield, lead guitarist Kirk Hammett, drummer Lars Ulrich and the late great bass player Cliff Burton), the band's cult following got them a major record deal with Elektra Records and the band went to Denmark with the band themselves producing and using one-time Rainbow engineer Flemming Rasmussen to help record their now classic major label debut which I found to be the case when I first got this album in May of 1989 on cassette. The album starts off with ""Fight Fire With Fire"" which at first sounded like it was going to be a ballad with acoustic guitars and clean electric guitars playing a relaxing melody but then Hammett and Hetfield's guitars come screaming in as was Ulrich's drumming which sounded like Bruce Lee on speed and Burton's bass playing which was superb. James' vocals on the track sounded sinister. We continue the rocking on the album's classic title cut which is a classic thrashy cut with tempo changes that would make the prog rockers happy. Next is another classic metal track ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" which is a superb rocker with a beat that sounds like marching off to war. The first half ends with ""Fade to Black"" which for the most part was a ballad before speeding up and was IMHO the Stairway to Heaven of the 80s as, like that song, starts soft then picks up then softens then gets harder and harder before the big finale. The album's second half kicks off with a classic thrash number called ""Trapped Under Ice"" which is just superb. Next is another great metal number ""Escape"". However, it's a shame that these two great songs are overlooked by many. We then come to one of Metallica's best pre-1991 masterworks ""Creeping Death"" which would remain a concert favorite and rightfully so cos this song is amazing. We end the album with the epic instrumental called ""The Call of Ktulu"" which sounds like the band had been listening to ELP, Genesis, Pink Floyd and Yes as the piece is filled with tempo changes, key changes and is just stellar, especially Hammett and Burton's solos on guitar and wah-wah bass respectively. While Ride the Lightning scraped the Top 100 upon its release without either radio or MTV or even mainstream media support, the album today is now their third largest selling album with some five million copies sold in the US alone today. Most Metallica fans from 1991 onward probably don't like this album but us purists who liked their speed metal sound in their early days then this album is for you. Highly recommended!",1
"There are many agruements of what the best Metallica album was. I have to say that Ride the Lightning was easily their best effort, and might be one of the top 10 metal records ever made. Every single song on this CD is a perfect 10, and every single tune is heavy as hell (except for Call of the Katula, but it does some crunching at the end) There is no way that Metallica will ever give us a release like this again. True the Master of Puppets is great to, but I don't think it quite measures up to Ride the Lightning. Master has really been worn out since I listened to it soooo much, that it really doesnt do it for me anymore. I still love Ride the Lightning as they day I bought it in 1986. ENJOY!",1
"The division between Kill 'Em All and Ride The Lightning is huge.  The albums sound like two different bands.  Amazing.  Where KEA was juvenile and garage-bandish, Ride The Lightning was the polished effort.  Don't get me wrong, a lot of great songs came from KEA, but Ride The Lightning is better.  Fight Fire With Fire opens up the album (back when it was an actual album) and never looks back!  Absolute pure shred!  Ride The Lightning, Creeping Death, Fade To Black, & For Whom The Bell Tolls!  All Classics!  Their first really professional effort for Electra, with the final batch of Dave Mustaine co-written tunes. Clearly one of the greatest metal albums of all time.  Dig it!",1
"Metallica.  Once brought up into a conversation, two things pop into a mans mind.  One of a historically important Thrash band, that made an impact upon almost anybody who cared to listen, and a historically important band that practically changed their name to Nutallica and also practically sold their souls for money.  Both of these are true, but the first is so fresh and original and important that to this very day, we still love these songs.  The true Metallica last from 1983 till 1991 at best.  Although there are only 8 songs here, they are all of a decently long length and are all so beautiful that you never want them to end.  This was Metallica, not the Metallica of today with 6 minute songs containing stupid lyrics, a trash can and no solos.  After the Black album pay no attention to them,  you'll only be disappointed, but back to this album.  Kill `em All was the beginning of Metallica, and here on their second album, they show growth and maturity as they write more important thing instead of Hit the lights or Whiplash (great songs but not important lyrically speaking).  Almost all of these songs are about Death.  Not death in the sense of Cannibal Corpse's Hammer Smashed Face, but more so in that that each is about a different issue, and makes a point and has something important to say.  With a short break down I'll show what I mean.  1. Fight Fire with Fire 10/10: one of the best and fastest metallica songs in my opinion.  This one is about Nuclear Warfare  2. Ride the Lightning 10/10: Beautiful solos, a song that you'll be happy to have stuck in your head.  This one is about the Electric Chair.  3. For Whom the Bell Tolls 10/10: slower, but one of the most important tracks here.  It's about the Spanish Civil war and also has something to do with H.P. Lovecraft, an author whom Kirk has a fascination with.  4. Fade to Black 9/10: a friend of mine finds this to be relatively boring.  In my opinion you need to be in the right mood for this song.  But when you are in the mood, this song rocks.  It is about Suicide, and from what I understand this song was also controversial because a man killed himself while listening to it back in the 80's.  5. Trapped Under Ice 8/10: Great song, the solos are great, the atmosphere is great.  It's about, well, being trapped under ice.  6. Escape 8/10: the only song not about death, more so about escaping from a town that wants you to be a certain way, and therefore rebelling.  Remember, 8/10 still means good, it's just that track 1-4 are classics.  7. Creeping Death 9/10: It's told through the eyes of the Grim Reaper.  An all around great song.  I love the middle part.  8. The Call of Ktulu 10/10: A beautiful instrumental, once again about an H.P. lovecraft story. I actually read this one and it's a good read, very strange.  In my opinion, this is far better than Orion from Master of Puppets, but that's just my opinion.  There is something about Ride the Lightning that I can not explain with any other record.  It has this strange dusty feeling to it.  When glancing at a copy of it, it appears to be rather old and unused (even a brand new copy).  Popping it into a CD player, the production has this weird dusty feeling to it that has the same feeling.  But when listening to it, it seems like a gem or relic that one has discovered in the attic of an old house.  It has this mystic atmosphere to it that can not be replicated or understood really.  James's voice also has a rough edge to it as well that isn't on other Metallica records.  This is my favorite Metallica record, as I can listen to it from start to finish and NEVER become bored at all.  Anyone who likes metal should have some Metallica in their collection.  I don't consider them to be the best metal band in history, (as a matter of fact I don't give that title to any band) but this is a valuable history lesson from the world of thrash.  Metallica were once great, people listened to metallica for those beautiful solos, for the touching and fun lyrics and song meanings.  But if you want a great drummer than look elsewhere because Lars is easily disposable, and I could name [insert any number here] of drummers that are better than him.  Lars just does enough to get by but he'll still have his moments of talent, though in this present day, I don't think there is a single person who doesn't want to just punch him in the face.  Well enough about this album, just find it, get it in your collection and enjoy.  Hoped this helped.",1
"Metallica's second album, 1984's ""Ride the Lightning,"" was the first real metal album I ever bought. When I bought it, I was looking for a really heavy album, so when the first track began with an acoustic intro, I was sorely disappointed. Luckily, however, I skipped to the next song, the title track, and its booming intro brought a big smile to my face. Ah, nostalgia.  With 1983's ""Kill `Em All,"" Metallica helped create thrash metal; but they followed up their debut with their sophomore album, which was released only a year later. Most metalheads have given it the credit it deserves, but I feel ""Ride the Lightning"" is still somewhat underrated, since the album that followed this one was ""Master of Puppets.""  ""Ride the Lightning"" is still fast. Most of it shoots by like...well, lightning; but it's slower, darker, heavier and more mature than ""Kill `Em All."" James' voice is somewhat lower than it was, and his lyrics are improved. As the above Amazon editorial review mentions, James discusses several different ways to die: Armageddon, capitol punishment, suicide, being trapped under ice, etc.  ""Fight Fire with Fire"" has the aforementioned acoustic intro, but it's just a tease-it doesn't last. The power chords fade in and the song becomes a breakneck speed, with rip-roaring, almost Slayer-esque guitar work. Lyrically, this songs seems to be about the Apocalypse.  ""Ride the Lightning"" is the album's most popular single. It's another thrashy number, with booming rhythms, fiery chug and churn riffs (which go from fast to faster to slow to fast), and an awesome, lengthy Hammett solo. ""Ride the Lightning"" has good lyrics about being executed by the electric chair, and it also has a surprise ending, but most of this song is an instrumental.  ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" is slower paced, but still loud and heavy. The first two minutes of this song is an instrumental, beginning with a bell ringing, then the heavy, repetitive, churning guitars kick in. This song has another good, winding solo near the end.  ""Fade to Black"" is really morbid because it has depressing, introspective lyrics about suicide. It begins with a distant guitar solo, but the acoustic strums actually make the first part of this song rather pretty. (Pretty in a dark and depressing way, but pretty nonetheless.) The choruses still have heavy riffs, and the end is an ascending and cascading solo.  ""Trapped Under Ice"" is very fast paced with another short but sweet guitar solo near the middle.  ""Escape"" has vocals which make it radio ready (it has good vocal hooks). Most of the song has propulsive riffs with thunderous drumming, but the choruses are slower.  ""Creeping Death"" begins with machine gun guitars and drumming, before changing to another fast beat with guitars that burn straight ahead. And, of course, there's another stellar solo near the end.  ""The Call of KTULU"" is the album's instrumental. In my opinion, this song IS as great as ""Orion"" (from Metallica's next album, ""Master of Puppets,"") and it's a very good way to end the album. It starts out slowly and ominously with wind wooshes, but then it suddenly becomes a lot faster. This song builds well and has superb guitar and drum work.  So, this disc is another wonderful landmark album and it's still one of the best C.D.'s of the past two decades. All of the qualities of a classic metal or thrash metal album are here: long songs (about 6 minutes per song), rapid fire riffs, ripping solos, an instrumental track, and even some acoustic guitar licks. In conclusion, if you want a complete metal collection, or if you just like heavy metal, you need this album more than you need your next breath.",1
"In 1984, Metallica had released their sophmore album entitled, RIDE THE LIGHTNING. This album turned out to be even better than KILL 'EM ALL. This album was definite in proving Metallica to be the best Heavy Metal act out there. This album has all the sound you could ever want from a Heavy Metal band.  FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE  This song is just astonishing. Any self-respecting Metallica fan would love this song. I sure as hell love this song.  RIDE THE LIGHTNING  Ah. The album's incredible title track. Can't get enough of this song and it sure can't get any better than this.  FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS  When I said it couldn't get any better than ""Ride The Lightning"", I was wrong. This album just keeps getting better, especially on this tune. Damn, this frigging guys can rock.  FADE TO BLACK  This song is my favorite off of the album. All I do is listen to this song a first time, then I start again for an encore presentation. If you listen carefully, you'll notice the song is talking about suicide. Gotta love this song.  TRAPPED UNDER ICE  Incredible.  ESCAPE  A great song with great lyrics and a rockin' sound.  CREEPING DEATH  As much as I love hearing this one, it creeps me out because of the title. But I can't help it when I just sing along with James on this one.  THE CALL OF KTULU  Instrumental song.  What an album! These guys know what fans want in a Heavy Metal album. This band is definitely going to be here for a long a** time. So get up off your a** and buy this album if you don't have it already.",1
"This is Metallica's second album Ride The Lighting which was released in 1984. Although it's not as good as Master Of Puppets, but it's still a classic gem. Picking up where their debut album Kill'Em ALL left off, Ride The Lightning has better production. The opening track Fight Fire With Fire starts off with a little accoustic intro, and suddenly warps into thrashing speed and will have you headbanging throughout. The title cut is another menacing headbanging track as well. For Whom The Bell Tolls and the awesome thrash ballad Fade To Black are two of the band's most popular songs. Creeping Death is another great song, and of course the closing track The Call Of Ktulu is an epic instrumental. James Hetfield's vocals are good, and his rhythm guitarwork is good as well. Kirk Hammet's lead guitarwork is splendid. Cliff Burton's bass lines are very menacing, and Lars Ulrich's drumming is good as well. Anyways, this is a great album and should be a part of your collection. Buy it now! R.I.P Cliff Burton  themetalbeast's ratings:  1. Fight Fire With Fire: 5/5  2. Ride The Lightning: 5/5  3. For Whom The Bell Tolls: 5/5  4. Fade To Black: 5/5  5. Trapped Under Ice: 4/5  6. Escape: 4/5  7. Creeping Death: 5/5  8. The Call Of Ktulu: 5/5",1
"Is it me, or was just about everything a lot cooler in the past? For instance, back in the '80s, Metallica was known for pounding, crushing, headbanging METAL, and now they're known for ripping fans off and liking money. It's a sad state of affairs.  But I digress. ""Ride The Lightning"" is easily one of the most awesome, headbanging, and skilled metal albums ever recorded. It rightfully earns its place in every metalhead's favorite album list. Insane drumming, loud riffs, blistering solos, and actual melody worked into the mix... once again, THIS is Metallica! From the intense, apocolyptic opener ""Fight Fire With Fire"", to the epic ""For Whom The Bell Tolls"", the beautifully written semi-ballad ""Fade To Black"", and, of course, the metal classic ""Creeping Death"", this album grabs a hold of the listener, and never lets go throughout the whole album!  Anyway, yeah, this one's a classic. Buy it, and steer clear of emo!",1
"If Metallica's 1983 ""Kill 'Em All"" wrote the book on thrash metal, then their sophomore release ""Ride The Lightning"" re-wrote the book on what metal was capable of. It was simply revolutionary at the time. Since ""Kill 'Em All"", the members of Metallica had seriously expanded their talents, technique and their approach with this groundbreaker. Every track offers something new, and experimental. The instruments aren't the only improvement. Hetfield's lyrics are much more personal, and conscious. The extended instrument arrangements blow everything from ""Kill 'Em All"" out of the water. Tracks such as ""Fade To Black"" and ""The Call of Ktulu"" were absolutely phenomenal works, untouched by the standards of 1984. And although it's up for debate, Hammett's guitar solos are my favorite on this album. Check out the two and a half minute guitar solo on ""Ride The Lightning"", that left my body covered with goose bumps as a teen, and still does to this day. Other highlights include ""Fight Fire with Fire,"" and ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"". This album rocks in epic proportions.  Overall, Metallica ruled the world at this point in time. There was no limits to their re-invention of raw, hardcore thrash metal. I was a huge Metallica fan growing up, and this one got spun the most. This is a absolute must have for anyone that claims they are a Metallica fan.",1
"THE 2ND ALBUM FROM METALLICA IS ANOTHER HEAVY METAL MASTERPIECE. AND IT'S QUITE POSSIBLY EVEN MORE ENTERTAINING THAN ''KILL EM ALL''! AMONG THE HIGHLIGHTS OF THE CD ARE ''TRAPPED UNDER ICE'', ''THE CALL OF KTULU'', ''FIGHT FIRE WITH FIRE'' AND ''FOR WHOM THE BELL TOLLS''. BETWEEN THE MONSTROUS GUITAR RIFFS AMD JAMES HETFIELD'S INTENSE VOCALS, I JUST CAN'T GET ENOUGH OF IT! FOR METALHADS, THIS IS NONSTOP EXCITEMENT. OTHERS SHOULDN'T EVEN CHECK THIS OUT.",1
"This is one of Metallica's pure best. Classic songs, good lyrics, adrenaline, and youth. The band was really coming together with this one. No MTV to sell to, little real radio support, this was the boys pounding out some of their best songs. Some of them are a little rough around the edges, production quality and musicianship reached its best with the next album, but this one is very good.",1
"Metallica's ride the lightning is a great cd. It is tied foe my favorite Metallica cd. The best four songs on the cd were ""Ride the Lightning"" ""Fade to Black"" ""For whom the bell tolls"" and ""Creeping Death"". My favorite two songs from those four are creeping death and ride the lightning. The other four songs are still very good. Overall, Ride the Lightning is a great cd, and one of the best of Metallica.",1
"This album is just plain good and very well worth owning. Ride the lightning is not as raw or fast as kill em all was,but its heavier and the production is better. It's a step up from their previous album. GO OUT AND BUY THIS TODAY!!!",1
"Ride The Lightning is one of the best albums of the thrash/speed metal genre and along with their next album Master of Puppets is Metallica's best work. While their first album Kill 'Em All relied more on speed metal, Ride The Lightning showed the band expanding their musical horizons and their songwriting abilities, which would lead to their breakthrough in America. Every track here is very strong with many of them becoming metal classics. The band wrote some of their best lyrics here as many of the tracks deal with personal issues such as drugs, death, and the struggle within. There is much diversity to be found here whether it's the excellent speed metal of ""Fight Fire With Fire"" and ""Trapped Under Ice"" or the longer epics ""The Call Of Ktulu"", the title track, and the awesome ""Creeping Death."" The menacing ""For Whom The Bell Tolls"" and ""Escape"" are also very strong tracks. Then there's ""Fade To Black"", the best track the band has ever recorded, and is to heavy metal what ""Stairway To Heaven"" is to classic rock. This is simply an incredible song, between its several different movements and its lyrics which tell of a man contemplating suicide. The guitar solo from Kirk Hammett during the song's outro is one of the best ever of the genre. Simply one of the best albums ever recorded in heavy metal. Highly recommended.",1
"Although many people say that The Black Album or Master of Puppets are Metallica's best albums, don't get me wrong they're great albums and they're in the 5 star worthy material but Ride the Lightning is my favorite Metallica and quite possibly my favorite thrash metal album, I think that 5 stars is not enough for Ride the Lightning, I easily give this album an 11. 'Fight Fire With Fire' starts off with a soft intro and it turns into a thrash metalhead's heaven and it's a killer song and I love the explosion at the end of the song. 10/10 'Ride the Lightning' is the title track and it's another Metallica classic although it isn't nearly as fast as the previous song but it's worthy enough to enter inside a thrash metalhead's mind. 8/10 'For Whom the Bell Tolls' starts off with the tolling bell and although I didn't think much for this song at first but the chorus lines helped me like this song and the tolling bells is awesome. 10/10 'Fade to Black' is a bit slower and softer than the previous songs they've done but Metallica can do a slower song very well (that is up until they're Load stuff) and the loud guitar's somewhat reminds me of Black Sabbath's Iron Man which is also a classic, and there are more songs to come that have the same vein as 'Fade to Black'. 10/10 'Trapped Under Ice' is probably my least favorite song off of this album but it's still a good song especially compared to their post-Black Album era. 7/10 'Escape' is probably the most underrated song off of this album and I actually like this song alot, and I wish that the same thing can be said with the other Metallica fans. 9/10 'Creeping Death' is another standout for this album and it's one of their heaviest songs off of this album. 10/10 'The Call of Ktulu' is the closing track and believe it or not, I actually didn't think much for this song but I gave it a few listens and now this is my favorite song off of this album and I could listen to this song like 5 times in a row and never get tired of it, Ride the Lightning is worth it for the price of this song alone and this song is easily one of heavy metal's best instrumentals of all time. 10/10 If you never heard of anything that Metallica has done before the Black Album? Then you're going to be in for a total surprise and this is the way how Metallica first started, if you liked the later Metallica stuff then you should get into their early stuff when they were total thrash but the best of both worlds, Metallica is now the MTV Icons.",1
"8 songs, 4 metal gods, raged guitars and full-on drums!!  Friends, welcome to PLANET METALLICA - OLD SCHOOL STYLE!!

"Do you remember when Metallica used to rock? I mean, they still rock(well, sort of), but do you remember when they used to ROCK? If you don't, I suggest you get Ride The Lightning ,not now, but right now! If you aren't convinced, check out this imaginary conversation between me and a potential customer: hiphopforlife(ME): Welcome to my review of Metallica's second album, Ride The Lightning. before I start, let me give you some background on the band...... Average Joe:Whoa, hold on. If your name is hiphopforlife, what are you doing reviewing a Metallica album? hiphopforlife: Be patient, homeboy. Yes I am black and the biggest lover of hip hop alive, but I am no joke as far as hard rock and metal go, since my taste ranges from Tool(LOVE EM!), Dream Theater(very underrated),Creed(very overrated),Limp Bizkit, Testament,Nirvana,Pantera,Slayer, Korn and Metallica;my first album was And Justice For All ten years ago (anotheralbum you should pick up). I am more than qualified to review this album. Now on to buisness. Ride The Lightning is the second album from the artists formerly known as Metallica. While their first album, Kill 'Em All, was raw and off the wall as you can get, the guys calmed down(somewhat calmed down) and created one of the most brilliant and inventive rock albums ever; and the scary part is that the album after this one, Master Of Puppets(a legend in it's own time) is BETTER! It starts off with Fight Fire With Fire, arguably Metallica's fastest song. Ride The Lightning is up next, which brilliantly looks into the final thoughts of a man about to meet his end in an elecrtic chair. For Whom The Bell Tools relaxes on the speed, but cranks up the heaviness with a great foundation riff from the late great bass player Cliff Burton. Fade to Black is next, which is Metallica's attempt and sucess at a ""power ballad""... Average Joe:Hold on ,hiphop;this has a ballad? Don't tell me that Metallica's gone Barbra Striesand or worse,Bon Jovi on us? hiphopforlife:To quote one of my rap idols, Ice Cube, KILL THAT NOISE! They have not wimped out by any means(the wimping out will be in 7 years).This is the second best metal ballad of all time(Sanitarium on Master Of Puppets is of course, number one. It is excellently written and sung by James Hetfield(the greatest metal vocalist of all time; sorry Ozzy).Trapped Under Ice and Escape are next; and to be honest, these two songs are just okay, in my opinion,which is why most people rank Master Of Puppets higher than Ride The Lightning; they aren't horrible, just okay. But the pace definitely picks up with the next two songs; DO NOT SKIP THEM! Creeping Death expounds on James' Christian scientist upbringing with a story on how Moses frees the Isrealites; it has a great middle part which makes the whole song worthwhile. Now it all comes down to the final song; the Call OF Ktulu, a superbly constructed instrumental which showcases all four members of the band's talents, especially the aforementioned Cliff Burton, who wraps up his title of the greatest bass player of all time.  That's Ride The Lightning, one of the most influential records from metal's most influential band. I would advise you to pick this up YESTERDAY, if not sooner. Average Joe: Thanks hiphop; you sold me. You are the greatest reviewer ever. And you, dear reader, will be sold as well on the past greatness of the band once known as Metallica. Get Ride The Lightning, as well as their whole 80's catalog(and the Black album ,if you must).",1
"Contrary to just about everyone else saying ""Master of Puppets"" is Metallica's best album, I have always felt ""Ride the Lightning"" was Metallica's finest, and my all time favorite album.  The album starts off with ""Fight Fire With Fire"", a song starting with a classical acoustic guitar riff followed by an extreme pulse pounding rhythm section courtesy of James Hetfield, and lyrics about the aftermath of nuclear warfare.  The title track deals with whats on the cover, awaiting execution in the electric chair.  The track also showcases Lars Ulrich's double bass drums.  ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"", one of Metallica's most recognized songs, showcases every band member's talents, especially Cliff Burton's sonic bass assault.  Up next is ""Fade to Black"", a haunting seven minute opus dealing with suicide, and this as well has become one of Metallica's most popular songs.  The song has a special meaning to me personally, it was the first Metallica song I had ever heard, and it helped me through some bad times.  ""Trapped Under Ice"" is about, of all things, being frozen suffocating under ice.  The lyrics give a chilling (no pun intended) feel to it, and the song has a great chorus.  ""Escape"" is hte only song that could be classified as ""filler material"", but it is a solid track in itself.  Next up is ""Creeping Death"", which is a concert staple to this day, and contains biblical references as lyrics.  This is another song that showcases every bandmembers talents.  The final track, the instrumental ""Call of Ktulu"" is very well done and we get to hear Cliff's bass talents put to the test and we hear Kirk Hammett shine on guitar.  The only complaint I can even think of is that the album is too short and it leaves you wanting more, but that's not really much of a complaint.  All in all, ""Ride the Lightning"" is one of the finest albums ever crafted, and the second of the first five Metallica albums that are essential to every metal fan's collection.",1
"I bought Ride the Lightening upon its release in 1984 when I was in 8th grade. My friends practically laughed me out of school for liking such ""[junk]"". Motley Crue and Ratt were the real metal bands back then. Well, I never have been one to be affected by peer pressure so I stuck to my guns. By the time we graduated in 1988 everyone of those guys who made fun of me in junior high were Metallica fans and they were the biggest metal band of the 80s. Here it is almost 20 years after its release and I still believe it is the best metal album ever made, even though I fell out of the Metallica camp by the early 90s and a lot of great metal albums have been released since.",1
"This is one of the best metal albums ever! I think most would agree that Master Of Puppets is better and I think I go against most people when I say that I prefer Kill Em All, but still this is fantastic. After releasing the killer (and at the time - original) debut, Metallica they release an even better album! Fight Fire With Fire sounds a bit cliched today with the quiet intro but it is one excellent song. Ride The Lightning is another great song and For Whom The Bell Tolls is quite sludgy and very good. They don't make riffs like that anymore! Then comes one of the best Metallica songs ever: Fade To Black. This is a quieter song which builds up progressively and is excellent. Trapped Under Ice and Escape are not so good but are listenable and they don't have me reaching for the skip button. Creeping Death is another excellent Metallica song and along with Fade To Black is one of the albums highlights. Then comes The Call Of The Ktulu. This is probably THE best metal instrumental I've ever heard! And to think that Lars was the only member of the band who was over 20 at the time - you won't find musical maturity like that in most bands - never mind that young - and certainly no nu-metal band will have it today. This belongs in any true Metalheads collection - there aren't many albums that are better than this.",1
"I have the very original release of the LP on the metal indie Megaforce, released just before Elektra here signed them and reissued the LP only a few months later, making the Megaforce original a collector's item.  Just total kick@$s metal all the way! The bonus CD could be ""Jump in the Fire"", but I aine sure.  On Vertigo or Sony (Japan).",1
"It's like this baby: Metallica helped define thrash metal in the 80s. With Kill 'Em All, they proved that they could play hard, fast, and with reams of energy. However, the subsequent release of Ride The Lightning proved to be a more thought-out collection of songs. Hetfield's peerless riffing is more refined, and his growling vocals are coming along (he still wasn't too great, though). Hammett's solos are mostly exciting, and he became one of the most copied lead guitarists around (in metal). Even Ulrich, whose drumming was always relatively simple, fits well with the music is gives it a crushing edge. Metallica has never been too focused on bass, so I feel sorry for Cliff Burton he doesn't really get too much attention. He still plays an important role in adding extra punch to the riffs, but one thing that's nice about Metallica's newer work is that the production is more accommodating to the different instruments. (Just a small gripe.) Anyway, this album tells you what Metallica was all about. The highlight of Ride the Lighting one of my favorite Metallica songs, ""Fade to Black."" It's a great anti-suicide song, that starts with slow, lugubrious guitar that builds up into heavy, powerful riffs. It concludes with exhilarating, punchy riffs and a glistening solo. Fans have written to Metallica saying that this song deterred them from taking the course of suicide...that's how good it is! ""Call of Ktulu"", the big instrumental, is almost symphonic in its interplay (which is why it works so well with the orchestra on S&M). ""Creeping Death"" and ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" are heavy, clomping thrash songs with interesting progressions and killer riffs. ""Fire Fire with Fire"" is mindless thrash with lots of kick. ""Trapped under Ice"" is tight speed metal. Ride the Lightning isn't as ambitious or complex as Metallica's follow-ups, Master of Puppets or ...And Justice For All. However, most of the songs are great one way or another. Here, Metallica driven by pure intensity and delivers a great, great metal album.",1
"THE BAND: James Hetfield (lead vocals, rhythm guitars), Kirk Hammett (lead guitars), Cliff Burton (bass guitars), Lars Ulrich (drums & percussion).  THE DISC: (1984) 8 songs clocking in at approximately 47 minutes. Included with the disc is a 6-page booklet with black & white band pictures, song credits/lyrics and thank you's. All music written by Metallica. Recorded at Sweet Silence Studios, in Copenhagen, Denmark. Label - Elecktra.  COMMENTS: I grew up with this album. Played the vinyl record in college so many times I wore it out (thank God for compact discs). This is still a classic Metallica album. However, decades later, I go back and forth with ""Ride The Lightning"". Thinking it totally shreds one week, and then the next week thinking it's so hard to get into. This album takes an acquired taste, and perhaps 'mood' is the better word. ""Lightning"" is Metallica finding their roots. Sure 6 of the 8 tracks are fragments of brilliance; atom splitting; rapid-fire assaults on the senses. The lightning quick songs are important in the band's library of songs. They had to go through these early stages to get to where they are today - so many years later. The title track is perhaps my favorite fast track on the album. The two slower songs - ""For Whom The Bells Toll"" and ""Fade To Black"" - are perhaps two of the best songs in the entire Metallica catalog. I can still listen to these songs anywhere, any time, any day. Both feature some amazing guitar work (both electric and acoustic). ""Call Of Ktulu"" is a 9 minute instrumental slugfest that I fell in love again with after their 'live' version on ""S&M"" simply blew me away. Decades after this release, it's still a classic in my book, but I have to be in the mood for it. Just a notch below ""Master Of Puppets"". Still a great disc.",1
"Right up until last year, I was never really much of a Metallica fan.  Then for some reason, I decided to get Garage Inc..  That in turn was followed by Justice, Black, Load, Reload, S&M, Puppets, and now, Ride.  Before buying S&M, I deciding to get the Cunning Stunts DVD.  And  believe me, I really enjoyed the spectacular concert the guys performed,  particularly, ""Creeping Death"" (probably the best song on the  DVD), ""For Whom The Bell Tolls"", and especially ""Kill/Ride  Medley"".  Those performances (along with the tracks on S&M) were  what prompted me to buy this CD. I was especially interested in hearing the  original versions of ""Fight Fire With Fire"" and ""Ride The  Lightning"" from the Medley.  And let me tell you, they are definitely  killer!  The machine-gun guitar and drum riffs were probably what made this  CD popular in the first place.  IMHO, Metallica help create speed/thrash  metal in the early/mid-80's.  Not only do you get the killer riffs, but you  also get the popular ""Fade To Black"" which is similar to  ""One"" in that it starts out really slow, then gradually picks up  speed before peaking at a fast guitar solo.  And then you have ""The  Call Of Ktulu"" which is an excellent instrumental by itself (however,  I prefer the S&M version; it sounds SO much better with the  orchestra!). Being a new Metallica fan, so to speak, I can start to see  why many of the longtime fans out there don't prefer the newer stuff  they've put out (I personally like both of the Loads).  Ride (along with  Puppets and Justice) was unique in the sense that Jaymz and company had the  guts to put out something that would stand the test of time to this day.  Even though I've heard it only a few times, I'm starting to appreciate it  already!",1
"This is one of the best Metallica albums, behind only Master of Puppets and the self-titled ""Black"" album. ""For Whom the Bell Tolls"" and ""Fade to Black"" are two of their best songs, and there isn't a bad one. The songwriting is a HUGE leap over their debut, with some of their best lyrics, not to mention countless classic riffs and solos. This is a must-have.",1
"...and the quality of Queensryche's music has done just that. Promised Land is a strange album for Queensryche to release, mostly because they had just enjoyed mainstream success with the likes of Empire. In contrast, Promised Land is much darker, more brooding and certainly less mainstream (arguably the least mainstream album the band have ever released). And that's a good thing right? Well, not necessarily. The fact that this is boring. Just because it is dark does not make it really intelligent. I respect the fact that they did what they wanted rather than lap up the commercial success like Metallica did at the same time. But that doesn't mean that everything they do is automatically brilliant because of it. The fact is that this has hardly any decent songs to mention. It lacks the energy of Warning and Queensryche EP, the accessiblity of Empire and the brilliance of Operation Mindcrime. It does have the wierdness of Rage For Order but in a bad way since it is resorts to uninspired sluggishness rather than the sinister almost industrial feel of Rage For Order. For an album that took 2 years to write and record, Queensryche don't have a lot to show for it. It seems like they were going out of their way to be different rather than just letting the music flow.",1
"I give Queensryche credit for trying something different with this album.  Clearly the music scene had changed immensely from their previous smash hit release ""Empire"", and yet Queensryche went is a direction of their own--not following the trends of the times.  And yet, this effort falls a bit flat in my estimation.  Maybe I am just like others who are fans of ""Empire"" and the epic ""Operation Mindcrime"" and shouldn't expect the band to remain the same.  Nonetheless, the catchiness of previous efforts is clearly lacking.  The song ""Disconnected"", which actually did make it to rock radio for a brief stint, sums up this album perfectly for me.  The first single released, ""I am I"" is one of the better tracks.",1
"After amazing albuns ""OPERATION MINDCRIME"" and ""EMPIRE"", this was a disapointment for me. Boring at the extreme, overproduced, it clearly show that the band was already losing their creativity vein.",1
"Queensryche has evolved considerably over the past 20 years of their prolific careers. They've gone from fiery heavy metal in the days of their EP to the lush rock-opera of Operation: Mindcrime, to the sublime perfection of the commercially successful Empire, to their current status as a generic rock band. In the middle of these last two phases comes Promised Land. Compared to the remarkable accessibility of Empire, Promised Land is a little more difficult to appreciate. Living up to the amazing success and quality of Empire is nearly impossible, and I do not envy Promised Land for what it tried to do. The problem lies in the fact that Promised Land's excellent songs are not as densely packed as those on Empire. Most of the songs are good, but not all the songs are excellent. There are moments of mediocrity that drag the album down from levels of excellence. The superlative production alleviates some of the boredom associated with the passable tracks, as do the thick wall-of-sound arrangements. However, interspersed amonst the middling pieces are some of the best tracks they've ever recorded, including some of the finest lyrics. The acoustic balladry of ""Bridge"" made for a lucrative single that deserved all its enjoined success. The sad, thoughtful ""Out of Mind,"" the ominous ""Lady Jane,"" and the hard rock trappings of ""Disconnected"" are all great. The true standouts are the stormy title track, with those monstrous arrangements and the harrowing tone, and the moving closer, ""Someone Else?"" The latter is the most un-Ryche song they've ever done, consisting only of piano and Geoff Tate's emotive vocals. The memorable piano riffs, thoughtful lyrics and Tate's passion are what makes this one special. Tate even strains on a note...guess he's human after all! Without the songcraft to elevate it to greatness, the production helps. A good Queensryche, almost a great one. Still, it can't touch the monolithic status of Mindcrime and Empire. In terms of songcraft, those albums are the band's best.",1
"Though not a true concept album like Operation: Mindcrime, Promised Land is an engaging conceptual-esque song cycle unified by simarily themed songs and myriad sound effects. From the opening collage of 9:28 AM we get right into the ""story"" with I Am I, which, along with The Bridge, was a minor album rock radio hit. Other standout tracks include Out of Mind, the epic title track, One More Time, and the personal, moving closing track Someone Else? which is made all the more poignant as it's arrangement consists solely of piano and Geoff Tate's world-class vocals. This is possibly the band's best set of lyrics ever, they are, for the most part, intensely personal, moving, and, at times, uplifting. Out of Mind, with it's conveyings of guilt and the sense of perspective it gives you, and the all too typical father/son story in The Bridge are the standouts in the lyrical department. The music and overall arrangements are also the best and most dense that Queensryche has ever put together. Though not their top album (that honor still belings to Mindcrime) this is one of their most interesting, and certainly one of their best.",1
"A friend said I would love this band.  Well... it was good.  Rock, some nice songs, but not too memorable. I like tecnho, nice beats, good poetic lyrics.  This wasn't' quite that.",1
One of the best trip hop albums ever.  Still terrific two decades later.,1
"I like most of the songs, but I find I can't listen to it over and over.  But great stuff to turn on in the background when I'm working.",1
"Oddly this album leaves you in a state of highness and in a good way.  The beats along with the oddly transfixing voice of the artist leave me wanting and needing more, just like a drug.",1
I purchase few complete CD's but this was one that I had to get. Most of the songs are really good and I love the smooth sound. I'm glad I've been introduced to trip hop.,1
"MEZZANINE is another masterpiece from MASSIVE ATTACK!!!! This is just the perfect music to relax and reflect about life...Its either great in a party!!!! It's amazing!!! The mix of REGGAE, HIP HOP, eletronic and ROCK are worderful on MEZZANINE!!! A MUSIC MASTERPIECE!!!! Try BLUE LINES and PROTECTION too....WELL DONE, MASSIVE ATTACK!!!!!",1
"This is simply the best Massive Attack album. If you only get one of their albums, make it this one. It's hard to explain the vibe of this album but it's very cool indeed, more so than their other albums. I guess I would say it's a real smart album.",1
"With a solid set of cold embraces, this massively influential trip-hop unit's most mature construct to date can fizzle off slightly in overly pseudo-cool but remains a must own for anyone interested in electronic music.",1
"There aren't many trip hop albums I have bought over the years that has managed to sound fresh every time I throw in the cd into my stereo or listen to it on my iPod. Massive Attack's 1998 classic ""Mezzanine"" is one of those few trip hop albums that still sounds as fresh today as I first heard it almost ten years ago. The music is a sublime mix of hypnotic electronic beats, seductive male and female vocals, and a diverse mix of samples from bands like The Cure.  What I love about ""Mezzanine"" so much is that the music is dark and sinister. All the death/black metal bands in the world cannot create music as richly dense and heavy as ""Mezzanine"" is. There is a terrifying quality to the music that the entire album would be a perfect film score for a psychological thriller. The first two songs ""Angel"" and ""Risingon"" sounds like they would be perfect scores for my nightmares. I can never get tired of listening to ""Teardrop"" which features Elizabeth Fraser on vocals. The production is neither too slick or too gritty. ""Mezzanine"" is one of the few albums I can actually call flawless. Every song is a Massive Attack classic.",1
"Teardrop, with the mesmerizing vocals of Liz Fraser, is the standout track - unfortunately the rest doesn't quite measure up. Don't get me wrong - Mezzanine is a very ""listenable"" album, something that works well playing in the background at night (some tracks work especially well for seductive exploits). It's just that the rest of this album sounds like second-rate Portishead.",1
"This is one of my favorite trip hop albums. The first four tracks are just amazing, and have me repeating them over and over. The songs respectively are  ""Angel,"" ""Risingson,"" ""Teardrop,"" and ""Inertia Creeps"". ""Angel"" has a stark production featuring pointed beats and a distorted bassline that frames the vocal and a two-minute flame-out with raging guitars. ""Risingson"" is a dense, dark sounding song with a ton of dub throughout. ""Teardrop"" is an awesome song where they collabored with Elizabeth Fraser from Cocteau Twins. ""Inertia Creeps"" is a highlight with an atmospheric sound, fuzz-tone guitars, and a wealth of effects, the song could well be the best production from the best team of producers the electronic world had ever seen. These songs are definately the highlight, and the other songs are still good, just not as good as these four in my opinion. Overall an awesome album that should have a place in every music collection.",1
"Massive Attack were one of the first gasps of trip-hop noticed outside of Bristol, and sadly they will be one of the last, it seems.  They are urban without the bounce and easy egotism of hip-hop.  They conveyed menace, but not the sinister pangs of angst echoed by Trent Reznor and Tori Amos during the same era.  They spoke volumes without words, and like Paul Oakenfold provoked an atmosphere, although Oakenfold reached for lofty heights while Massive Attack belongs in the darkened alleys and underground clubs.  Through its incarnations, Massive Attack has been an intellectual's house party in a 1930's brownstone in Chicago's Wicker Park, rain on the windows of a high-rise over L.A., and the smoke, mud and confusion of a college rave.  Mezzanine is complex, both within the tracks and in the connective tissue between them.  It is dark on the bright side, more a 4 a.m. flicker of streetlamp than a dawn of any sort.  Its power is in a balance of rhythm, drive and deep-seated anxiety that begs for further listen.",1
"""Mezzanine"" is another classic album by the legendary group Massive Attack, and I would even argue that it's better (there aren't any bad songs and the best songs here are simply extraordinary)! The best tracks are the first four songs which deliver a 1-2-3-4 of such creative genius that it'll instantly make you a fan. Sometimes relaxing, sometimes haunting, and always groovy, ""Mezzanine"" delivers a worthwhile follow-up to ""Blue Lines"" that ""Protection"" failed to be. Like ""Blue Lines"", ""Mezzanine"" features several singers who are ALL very likable and charismatic (""Blue Lines"" suffered from the track ""One Love"" where the singer arguably kind of ruined the song). The lyrics aren't as memorable as on ""Blue Lines"", though, but you won't mind. Overall it's a much darker album than ""Blue Lines"" as it occasionally blends metal and industrial music with their trip-hop sound. Hip-hop and probably casual music fans will love this album. A word for the wise: the rest of the album might take a bit before you  realize how good it is. Anyways - very highly recommended along with their first album ""Blue Lines"" and Portishead's ""Portishead"" (though this one isn't as good).  Highlights include: the entire album!",1
"You've heard their music in commercials and movies and may not have realized it. I didn't until I picked this album up within the past six months. Of it, Blue Lines, and 100th Window (only ones I have), it's the best, and that is clearly in consensus with other MA fans. This is a very good album...just really interesting and exceptional musically.  If you're at all interested in this kind of music, you cannot go wrong with Mezzanine.  EDIT: I've actually been listening to this album more over the last 24 hours and am now of the opinion that it's more masterful than I originally thought. It's easily listenable from start to finish. There are no weak songs. If you think you've found a weak song, you've just not listened to it enough yet. This album will be especially enjoyable for somebody with a good sound setup (be it high quality earphones or, preferably, a nice car stereo) because some of its bass lines are truly praiseworthy.  As others have alluded to, or stated, this is the kind of CD that holds a constant spot near the top of one's music collection. I knew it was good, but only now do I fully understand that fact. Isn't it a breath of fresh air when a single album is full of such greatness and not just one or two songs, as with 99% of the music out there?",1
"It is said that imitation is the best form of flattery. If this is true, the fact that several years after its release, the opening ""Angel"" continues to appear on Original Soundtracks should speak volumes. From the first chord, the third album by the band that brought trip-hop to us along with Portishead and Morcheeba is yet another classic. At several points, it feels like a precedent to some of the chillout acts to come in later years (remember this was released in 1998). With a tight bass sound streaming from song to song, a sexy beat and a hypnotic keyboard frame to it all, this album lacks nothing, and raises the bar above their previous 'Protection' where the main thing I miss is the participation of Everything But The Girl's vocalist, Tracy Horn. Think no more and get it!",1
"I don't know too much about their other albums, but I can't imagine any other being better than ""Mezzanine"". You can call this trip-hop or electronica if you want, but this is just cool mood music that is beyond beautiful. Perfect for putting on after the bars at home, with that last drink or smoke of the night. With guest vocals from ""The Cocteau Twins"" singer, and a cool sample of ""The Cure"" on track seven, you know this is gonna be good. ""Teardrop"" was the big song from this, and the rest is just as moving. It will go great with your ""Portishead"" and ""Sneaker Pimps"" cd's.",1
"I haven't been into Massive Attack for too long, probably a couple of years now. ""Mezzanine"" was my very first MA album. I bought it because I heard nothing but good things about this group as well as this album. The rest is all history. I have their other three albums [""Blue Lines"", ""Protection"", and ""100th Window""]. I think of all the MA albums I own, ""Mezzanine"" resonates with me the most. The music is dark and foreboding, lyrically and musically. The cd starts off with the dark sounds of ""Angel"". I particularly love that songs for the dark, slow, hip hop beats mixed with the haunting vocals. The choices in samples is astounding, if not refreshing. Normally I loathe the use of samples but Massive Attack is able to use samples and manipulate them into a totally different sound than what the original artist intended. My personal favorite songs off ""Mezzanine"" has to be ""Man Next Door"" and ""Teardrop"". Those songs are simply amazing. I recently put in ""Mezzanine"" into my cd player for the first time in months, and amazingly enough it still holds up very well in today's current music scene. I really think that ""Mezzanine"" set a standard for the whole genre of trip hop music. It is one of the best albums in that genre as well as one of the best albums in general to come out in the past decade or two.",1
"Mezzanine is one of my all time favourite albums. It's just that good. the arrangements, the production and the wibe on the album. It's dark and beautiful and the musicianship is also top notch. the Album has many guest appearences and the lads from Massive are geniuses to find the right people to sing the right songs. Teardrop is now a classic and many other songs are also brilliant. I recomend everyone who claims to be a music fan to buy Mezzanine. It is indded one of the best albums of the late 90's and probably of all time.",1
"...seductive, spellbinding.  There are probably many other words out there that can describe this record, but the five I've mentioned are probably the closest that will match the feeling I get from listening to it.  Imagine a dark, tranquil atmosphere with shimmering electronic music and bassline grooves and narrative, soulful vocals in the background.  ""Mezzanine"" perfectly fits this description!  Some of the highlights include ""Angel"" where the music starts soft and then builds up into a screaming frenzy.  Or how about ""Teardrop"" (w/former Cocteau Twins vocalist Elizabeth Fraser) which features an angelic voice, an acoustic guitar, and the same shimmering electronics.  I could go on and on.  But I think it's best that you go out and buy this fine record and experience it for yourself.  If I'm not mistaken, it was one of SPIN magazine's top 20 records of 1998.  Heck, I bought it just before Christmas last year and wondered what took me so long in doing so.  In any case, I'll definitely look into buying their other stuff including the DVD!  And I look forward to their new record which should be coming out sometime this fall!",1
"What struck me first after hearing Mezzanine was its sheer weight. The sound, with its low beats and (in a first for Massive Attack) thrashing guitars, succeeds in actually oppressing the listener....and that's very  much a good thing, because the music in this album is just so very novel  and smooth you want to feel every part of it. As usual with Massive  releases, ""Mezzanine"" features the vocals of two female vocalists  on several songs, Liz Fraser (formerly of Cocteau Twins) and newcomer Sara  Jay. Liz's contributions are some of the higher points of the album, and  ""Teardrop"" is just the most beautiful song to come out of 1998.  Sara Jay's one song is the insidious and sneaky ""Dissolved Girl,""  which has Massive Attack doing some new tricks with electronica. Horace  Andy, the reggae singer who is a mainstay of Massive Attack's albums, has  three songs here, the industrial ""Angel,"" and the almost-retro  Massive Attack ""Man Next Door"" and ""(Exchange)"". The  songs featuring the vocals of Massive's members 3D and Daddy G are also  well-done, and 3D's threatening whispers on ""Risingson"" do a lot  to make it one of my favourite songs. Although certainly some of the  songs are better than others, this is one of the few CD's I've ever  listened to where there is not a single bad song. The album as a whole is  perfect, and I would recommend this to any person who is breathing and has  a pulse.",1
I remember when this came out on lp in the early 70's.  Thank God it has been re-issued on cd.  This is what Philly sould is all about!,1
"The Stylistics make moody soul music, atmospheric. There's also a hint of Warrick - Bacharach  in their music, well, after all they did cover ""You'll never get to if you break my heart"", and the joyous ""Make it last"" carries on in that vein.  Other than that song, in my opinion this album doesn't really get going until the second half - the jazzy slow burn of ""Love comes easy"", the off-hand rock 'n' roll title track, the soul classic ""You make me feel brand new"" and the exuberant ""I won't give you up"".  But, the highlight for me is undoubtedly ""There's no reason"" with it's off-kilter melody, interesting arrangement and rolling chorus with the perfect vocal harmonies. Along with most of the other songs, the gentle, understated sound adds to the whole atmosphere.  Songs like ""Only for the children"" and ""Could this be the end"" - I don't know. I've always thought Russell Thompkins Jr is at his best singing love songs, because it suits his vocal style than angrier songs. Overall I would give this album a 7, or three and a half.",1
"1973, the Philly wonder group Stylistics release their third album after the first 2 albums, 2 straight classics.  Thom Bell and Linda Creed make a great production team, and Russel Thompkins Jr. keeps hitting the high notes as the lead tenor.  The music is lush again like the second album Round 2, and there are some surefire winners here.  ""Make It Last"" has the same lushness of songs like ""You'll Never Get To Heaven (If You Break My Heart)"" from Round 2.  ""Payback Is A Dog"" is about how a woman who does wrong will finally know how it feels when she is on the receiving side of the heartbreak, and has impeccable harmony.  ""Love Comes Easy"" has that smooth lush feel again and deals with finding one great thing in life in an uneasy world: love.  ""Rockin' Roll Baby"" has a vintage 70's rock feel with the great falsetto lead (giving it a soul inflection), and a light touch of funk.  Not my fav, but it shows that the Stylistics can expand into different territory effectively.  A persistent sentiment of love even if unrequited is expressed in the nice mid-tempo ""I Won't Give You Up.""  Then we have a great jam with the slower ""Let Them Work It Out,"" which is more laidback and deals with a certain friend who gossips about other friends' love lives (and troubles in said romances), and that it is getting annoying.  The song is about letting couples work through their difficulties.  A somber joint is ""Could This Be The End.""  It is another slower joint with perfect harmony.  Rockin' Roll Baby is another classic in the Stylistics catalogue.  Thom Bell is a genius musician, especially considering his classic works with The Delfonics, The Stylistics, The Spinners, among others.  The Stylistics are right next to the Delfonics as 2 of my favorite soul groups ever.",1
"I'm a life long Blue Oyster Cult fan from way back, in 1988 they released ""Imaginos"" #122, at the time I thought this was a tremendous record, but after 22 years of reflection, it's a 4 star release at best.  This is a upgrade after ""Club Ninja"", but that wasn't very hard to do.  The thing about ""Imaginos"", it has too many special guests and the recording was 5 or 6 years in the making. (I didn't know that at the time I bought it in '88).  I still like these songs after 22 years, ""I Am The One You Warned Me Of"", ""Les Invisibles"", ""Magna Of Illusion"", with some fine piano by Allen Lanier, the remake of their own ""Astronomy"" #9 mainstream rock and my favorite tune is the classic ""Blue Oyster Cult"", just a great track, Buck and Eric at there best.",1
"OK, it may have started out as a great ""concept album"" in the mind of Sandy Pearlman. It may have grown into a Joe Bouchard solo album, which stretched out over multiple recording dates. It may have ended up as the ""final"" BOC album in 1988 because of the fact that Joe Bouchard was joined in sessions by Eric Bloom, Allen Lanier, Buck Dharma and Albert Bouchard.  So WHAT?  It's got the bone-rattling, truly unique ""The Siege and Investiture of Baron von Frankenstein's Castle At Weisseria,"" featuring Joey Cerisano and Jon Rogers on additional lead vocals and the unforgettable shout/chant/refrain ""CARPE DIEM"" followed by doomsday crashing riff-heavy guitars, and the opening track ""I Am the One You Warned Me Of,"" which is easily as good as any of the tracks on the early BOC albums.  There's also a remake of two songs from the second album (""Tyranny & Mutation""), ""Astronomy"" and ""Subhuman"" (which is retitled ""Blue Oyster Cult"" here).  Sometimes it pays to focus on what an album IS as opposed to what it ISN'T.  This one will shake the fillings loose from your teeth. It may be a patchwork quilt but it rocks like a mother, and the fact that it's back on CD is worth celebrating.",1
"Back in the day BOC was Huge. I loved their music and got everything they ever put out EXCEPT ONE, Imaginos. I was overseas in the Navy when it came and the 2 albums prior to this were a bit of a disappointment, SO when it came out I was busy and just didn't get around to getting it. when I did go to get it it was gone. Pulled from the shelves everywhere for what I don't know but nowhere to be found. No big deal right? I mean tha last 2 releases were rather dull so I figured BOC were tapped out,  becoming Nostalgic and Nundane. Many years before I even expressed interest in it again after I heard from others that it was actually very good. Some of the best BOC has ever done many say. Hmmmm. better get it. NOT, everybody wanted like mega bucks for a copy. Anyway when I saw it here re-released I jumped all over it. Damn glad I did. When I first listened to this and keep in mind, for 30 years I have never heard even one track from this CD, it was like hearing the latest release form one of my favorite bands and it rocks. As a whole I give it an 8 on a 10 scale but there are about 5 songs on this that are the best BOC has ever done. Those songs get a solid 10. Buck is blazingly fast and imaginitive. ie the title Imaginos. These are Blockbuster, Genious Level Guitar Riffs that prove once again that Buck Dharma is one of the greatest guitarists alive and way too many people have never heard of him. A shame really. BOC has a Dark Inteligent perspective that always kept them to, well, cult following status. I am a member of that BOC Cult. I like just hearing this now because it truly feels new and fresh to me. I know it came out in 1978 or 79, and it is now 2008. But you can'yt tell that from hearing this for the first time. It sounds like so much of BOC's greates work. Classic and Timeless. If like me you are a BOC fan and you don't have this. You already know from the years that you gotta have it. If you are a new BOC fan or wondering if this is Vinatge BOC or just mediocrity from BOC, let me assure you this will top your collection as some of BOC's finest and without a doubt Buck Dharma soundly places himself in the Guitar God Status like he wasn't there already.

"An album that has always seemed to divide BOC fans.  ""Imaginos"" is a concept album concocted by Albert Bouchard and Sandy Pearlman whose origins go almost back to the beginning of the band.  Two of the tracks on this album appear on ""Secret Treaties"" which serves as somewhat of a companion piece to ""Imaginos"".  The original BOC lineup re-united for this one along with a host of guests.  The concept is the story of Imaginos a time traveler of sorts who appears at different times in the world's history to influence historical events.  The problem is that the story is not told in a linear fashion and it ends up being completely confusing.  I have read essays on the story behind the story and still haven't really figured it all out.  This is a weird album for me, I think most of the songs on this disc are outstanding to the point of being some of the best stuff BOC has ever done, but looking at the album as a whole it is not quite as good as I think it should have been.  Being a big progressive rock fan maybe I set my expectations too high when I found out BOC was doing a true concept piece, but on this one the sum is not greater than it's parts.  That being said there is some really great material here.  The remakes of ""Astronomy"" and ""Blue Oyster Cult"" (formerly ""The Subhuman"") are better than the originals.  ""I Am The One You Warned Me Of"", ""Les Invisibles"", ""In The Presence Of Another World"", ""Del Rios Song"", ""The Siege....."", ""Magna Of Illusion"" are all awesome.  The title track is a bit of a letdown, but still ok.  Still......even with all this great stuff, I think the album could have been put together better and re-worked to an extent.  Anyway this is a minor quibble as this album really is a must for any fans of BOC.  I believe it is currently out of print and hard to find.",1
"This is an album the Blue Oyster Cult fans will really get into, a concept album that showcases the bands unique song stylings. For the casual listener, or sometime BOC fan, stick with ""Agents of Fortune"" or ""Fire of Unknown Origin"". ""Imaginos"" is a heavy album and features a great remake of ""Astronomy"", the best song on the CD. But unless you are prepared to invest some time, deciphering the story, and songs you won't get much out of the album. I picked up ""Imaginos"" on CD after hearing ""Astronomy"" late at night (the best time to play the CD), and there was a narrative about the ""Imaginos"" myth read by Stephen King as the song opened. I heard this only two times on the radio, and picked up the CD because I was a huge Stephen King fan, and enjoyed some of BOC's earlier albums. Needless to say, the Stephen King narrative is not on the album. I was disappointed, but played the disk a few times. I enjoyed ""I Am The One You Warned Me Of"", a pretty straight ahead rocker, and ""In The Presence of Another World"" which is a more down-tempo song. Actually most of the songs are good, and you will find yourself humming the chorus for hours after listening. The only track that I found lacking, was the title track ""Imaginos"". For some reason, most likely the background singers: ""Oooohhhh Imaginos, Ooooohhh Imaginos, Oooooohhhh, ooooohhh, ooohhhh Imaginos"" the song sounds like fanfare for a two bit magician about to perform in Vegas or something. Once I got that image stuck in my head, I just kept picturing Imaginos The Great performing card tricks and turning newspaper into doves. If you see a copy of this disk used for under $10 pick it up, but I don't think it's worth the $20 used price I see here.",1
his first and one of his best albums other than the first Marshal Mathers lp in my opinion,1
"I wanted an album so rugged, nobody could touch it, Eminem proclaims. If hes referring to rap albums, this LP might just be that. Ill say here and now, with no hesitation or reservation, that Eminem is easily the best rapper Ive ever heard. No popular rapper you can think of, alive or dead, even comes close. I mightve been saying the same about guest Royce Da 5-9 if he weren't upstaged by a rapper whose comedic wit, clever wordplay and sheer rhyme skills near genius.  There is very little filler in Eminems verses. Even when hes lacing them with unnecessary profanities; the Slim Shady persona is a deviant (white-trash) druggie who aims to offend; almost every two bars are a quality set and many of those sets are classic quotables. Unless hes cheating it somehow, his creativity is close to amazing. He even does his own sound effects. The beats are also impressive, so the albums only major drawbacks fall on faulty choruses and silly skits.  marcellee.com",1
This is an awesome cd it is fun and enjoyable to listen to. the best songs on this cd are  Tracks  2. My Name Is 3. Guilty Conscience 4. Brain Damage 6. If I Had 9. Role Model 13. Cum On Everybody 14. Rock Bottom 15. Just Don't Give A 18. I'm Shady 19. Bad Meets Evil 20. Still Don't Give A  if you have not listened to this cd then i recommend you do,1
"Before the Slim Shady LP, a no-name emcee named Eminem was probably ripping the mic at the Lyricist Lounge or other underground hiphop spots...back when he was an ill lyricist hungry for attention by scaring you sh**less with raw punchlines and excellent verbal battling ability.  Back when he was able to step into a rhyme cypher with Canibus, Mos Def, Last Emperor, and Chino XL and dominate...  To a hiphop standpoint, by focusing on his lyrics and comparing with his earlier efforts, this CD is the beginning of his downfall...  But with the variety of ideas it saves the CD.  And by being so creative brings it up to 5 stars... Unfortunately, because he's not on a dependable label he's forced to rap to garbage beats (which is Dre's specialty, but this release are some of his better ones), he's forced to do exactly what the higher level employees he works with say.  He's not able to make his own decisions and the contoversy that has become of him has forced him to listen to Dre and others and rap about that instead of making his own ideas... ARTIST - one that can use their imaginative ability to create something... But, none the less, an excellent debut CD by a good artist who's stuck with a bad label...  Hopefully one day Slim will wake up and leave DRE in his footprints and join a true HIPHOP label 'RAWKUS' ... plus he's not the only white rapper out there today: Evidence (Dilated Peoples), The High and Mighty, Smut Peddlers, Everlast/Whitey Ford, El-P (Company Flow), and RA Rugged Man... I'm Out ... Mind Power!",1
"Now this is what you call some quality recording by a quality artist.  Ledisi is a good definition of ""grown folk"" music. The songs were well written and I can about imagine what her performance was like. She seems to really be into her music.  There is nothing scripted about it.  You can feel the passion coming from her voice as well as the creativity that was put into the music, which is somewhat of an lost art in today's world of music.  I highly recommend this cd to any fan of real soul music.",1
"Now I have just finished my reviewing Ms Ledisi's major debut:<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost-and-Found/dp/B000RO8UAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost and Found</a>, which, whilst being a nice safe release, is nothing like this. Now this is a album, and I can well understand why this is an in demand CD. I like the live feel to this CD, and the excellent choice of songs on offer: from the excellent 'Get Outta My Kitchen' 'Coffee', and the controversial 'Papa Love to Love me' I think what this CD has that her:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost-and-Found/dp/B000RO8UAQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost and Found</a>&nbsp;CD lacks is, apart from edgier songs selection, is a jazz influence that runs through this CD. It's sad that with an independence like this, the freedom that an artist has is lost when dealing with the majors. As Ms Ledisi owns the master for this I do hope it sees a re-lease on her new label, because the masses need to hear this.",1
"Ledisi - Soulsinger (2000) Word has it that this album is to be rereleased this year on Tommy Boy Records. If this is true, then I'm glad that she's getting a second chance. Soulsinger is filled with Ledisi's ability to mix little spoken word with jazz, R&B, and soul. She puts her all in every performance, as evidenced in ""Take Time"" and ""Coffee"". She has the voice of a throaty Southern gospel choir singer and she truly delivers. It's too bad that some of these songs have uninspired lyricism like in ""Groove On"", a song about her wanting a one-night stand. Also, she tends to sing so hard that she gets off-key, which is a problem throughout the album. But it's hard to find powerful singers like her these days and by listening to ""Free Again"" and the very revealing ""Poppa Loved to Love Me"", Ledisi should start getting props soon. -EJR",1
"Ledisi is less than average...there, it had to be said! if hating on this album is wrong, then i'ma be wrong. being a good poet doesn't always equate to being a good recording artist. she is definitely different than anything else being offered out there now, and i'll always give an artist props for originality, but i'm just jaded and expect more for my money. this just doesn't move me, sorry.",1
"I REALLY ONLY BOUGHT THIS CD FOR TWO SONGS, AT FIRST THEN I LISTENED TO THE WHOLE CD AND IT IS REALLY NOT BAD",1
"The Left Banke were one of those groups who seemed to shine briefly but brilliantly and then fade into relative obscurity. That said, they did manage at least one better than ordinary album (this one) and an OK follow up (Left Banke Too), the latter release sadly missing the original group's principal songwriter Michael Brown. For all that these guys did record one of the best and most beautiful songs ever put down by anyone in Walk Away Renee and that is way more than many other musicians will ever achieve.. First class packaging and well written booklet with band history etc. Worth buying if you like quality 60's music",1
"The Left Banke is one of those bands from the 60s that kinda fell through the cracks as the years went on.  Pretty much looked at as a ""two hit wonder"", they were much more than that(as One and Two Hit Wonders tend to be sometimes). They're classified as ""Baroque Rock"".  What the hell is that, you ask?  Oddly, it sounds exactly like it's description.  The band members of The Left Banke weren't the most technically savvy of musicians, so the sound of the band revolved around youngest member, Michael Brown.  Brown was trained in classical music and played piano and harpsichord, both of which are very prominent in The Left Banke's sound.  Add to that, the smooth Beach Boys-esque vocal harmonies, and you have.....Baroque Rock!!  One song, Evening Gown, almost sounds like a harpsichord driven punk song! I'm surprised I like this album as much as I do.  Though I'm big on vintage rock music, this seemed a little too different than what I normally listen to, which is rockabilly and surf. I initially bought it because I've always had a soft spot for Pretty Ballerina, but much to my surprise I found this whole album to be great! I am very glad I picked this one up!  If you like the late 60s stuff, The Left Banke deserves a resurrection.  If you like Justin Bieber, you're a schmuck!",1
"This is a very special cd. It is a tribute to Debby's mother-in-law Rosemary Clooney so that makes it special in itself. But whats really special is this womans' voice - so perfectly suited for this material. As a fan from the start of her career I know how versatile she is. Here she sings with authority and with the technique of a jazz legend. For us fans who have been waiting for new material from Debby for years this is just what the doctor ordered. This cd is perfect for a night of romance with fine wine and Boones' beautiful vocals washing over you. The production has class written all over it from the players to Debby Boone. Looking forward to the live show - it will rock! Congratulations Debby and thanks for keeping your music and your life real. God Knows :).....postscript - i was lucky enough to catch Debbys' live show at Scullers in Boston 6/22/05 and she truly charmed and dazzled her audience. Debby - thanks for being such an inspiration and a true lady...as I said ""keep the good music coming!"". :)",1
"This is a very moving collection of Debbys' Christian music as is the recent ""You Light Up My Life - Greatest Inspirational Songs"" - if you like this you'll like that too. Boone has a dramatic soaring voice that comforts the soul. Can't wait to get her latest on Concord Records ""Reflections of Rosemary"" a tribute to mother in law Rosemary Clooney. She may finally get the props she deserves.",1
"I would have liked a dance band with at least 15 pieces or more to accompany Debby. She has the ""chops"" & I believe that this would enhance her sound. The band was still good but it could be a fuller sound.",1
"The songs in this album ""Reflections of Rosemary"" from ""Blue Skies"" and  ""Mood Indigo"" to ""In The Wee Small Hours Of The Morning"" and ""Time After Time"" are some of the nicest popular standards identified with Rosemary Clooney, one of the best female vocalists of all-time. And Debby Boone is singing the same songs as her special tribute to her mother-in-law. This album promises the listeners an unforgettably, wholesomely beautiful listening experience. There is something to captivate the ears of every listener as she is backed by some of the best musicians we have in the music world today: Rosemary Clooney's arranger/pianist for twenty years, John Oddo, arranger Earl Brown, guitarists John Pizzarelli and Jim Fox, bassist Chuck Berghofer, drummer Gregg Field, percussionist Daniel Greco, saxophonists Gary Foster, Dan Higgins and Scott Hamilton, trumpeter Warren Luening and cellist Armen Ksajikian.  I have enjoyed the music of Debby Boone since she recorded an album of great inspirational songs in the seventies and eighties most notably ""Sweet Adoration,"" ""Can You Reach My Friend?"" ""Sincerely Yours"" and ""You Light Up My Life."" Her father's music, Pat Boone, has been part of my very musical family when I was growing up. He was one of my late parents' favorite singers and mine, too and I was especially fond of his hit song, ""Love Letters In The Sand.""  On this elegantly charming tribute album recorded with love and dedication,  Debby Boone sings sixteen classic standards starting off with an uplifting  Irving Berlin classic, ""Blue Skies,"" which Rosemary Clooney used to sing to her first grandson Jordan, whenever he was ""sad, when he took a fall and was crying, or anytime he needed his spirits lifted."" It's a surprised added track - Ms. Clooney's A Capella version. Ms. Boone stated that, like her son Jordan, she would always find comfort in this beautiful song, which highlights Scott Hamilton on tenor sax solo.  While all the tracks are so enjoyable, I really love the way she sang ""Mood Indigo,"" which features a vocal quartet - herself and her sisters Cheryl, Lindy and Laury with vocal chart arrangement written by Earl Brown. With its vintage-sounding arrangement and its nostalgic rendition, this classic from Duke Ellington/Barney Bigard/Irving Mills evokes a sentimental feeling that will flood your eyes with an ocean of tears as the sisters sing...  Little sister, you ain't been blue No, no, no You ain't been blue Not till you've had that mood indigo That feelin' goes stealin' down to your shoes Then you cry, you just sit there and cry Go long, so long blues...  Always get that mood indigo Since my baby said goodbye In the evenin' when lights are low I'm so lonesome I could cry  The wonderful tone of John Pizzarrelli's guitar as well as his soft and mellow scat can be heard in ""I've Grown Accustomed To His Face"" while Dan Higgin's flute plays beautifully in ""It Might As Well Be Spring"" complementing Ms. Boone's gorgeous vocals. The Van Heusen/Burke medley is also surprisingly stunning ""But Beautiful,"" ""Moonlight Becomes You"" and ""Like Someone In Love."" One of my all-time favorites ""The Music That Makes Me Dance"" by Jule Styne and Bob Merrill was rendered so beautiful and heartfelt making it one of the best interpretations ever recorded. And she dedicated it to her hubby, Gabri. The delicate medley of ""It Never Entered My Mind"" and ""In The Wee Small Hours Of The Morning"" was selected as a tribute to Frank Sinatra, whom Ms. Boone had worked with on several occasions in the past. The enchanting Bossa Nova arrangement on ""The Best Is Yet To Come"" is so pleasing to the ears.  An all-time top favorite, Sammy Cahn and Jule Styne's ""Time After Time"" is also a highlight and one of the singer's favorite songs that Chet Baker recorded in an album called ""Chet Baker Sings."" According to her, ""she fell in love with that album in 1996 and developed a real school girl's crush on Chet. She spent summer tirelessly delighting in his trumpet playing and melting at the sound of his voice, not to mention his picture."" She then sent a copy of the record to Rosemary knowing that she would absolutely ""love the way this guy sang."" And to her surprise, Rosemary told her; ""Do you know I carry around a picture of Chet Baker in my wallet to this day?"" In other words, they had a crush on the same guy! Co-incidentally,  ""Chet Baker Sings"" is also my very first Chet Baker CD from my collection and I have written a review on this outstanding album about a year ago. It's a very nice album that focuses on Chet Baker not as a trumpet player but as a singer with a soft and mellow vocal style.  Listen to Debby Boone at her utmost best as she pays homage to one of the best female singers of all-time, Rosemary Clooney. You'll also be delighted with the Liner Notes, which include in great detail Ms. Boone's heartfelt sentiments for each and every song she selected for this great tribute album.  An album of sheer beauty, elegance and perfection.",1
It is a very good album and of high quality output.  I listen to it on my way to work and it energizes my spirit!  I choose 5 stars because it is 5 stars.  Every song is great and unique in itself!,1
Great praise and worship music! Praise is what I do is my fave song of choice. HIghly recommend this cd.,1
William Murphy does a great job in delivering his gospel message to gospel lovers such a myself. His presentation is unique and his style can not be confused with anyone else like some artist. He stands out as a great gospel artist and I am pleased with this particular CD.,1
"If you can only purchase 1 CD, it should be this one. William Murphy is Gospels greatest hidden talents. His work will inspire you.",1
"First off, thanks to Jeff Feezle for listing the album content. All the songs are first rate by original artist.  Perry, Les, Eddie, Tony, and the rest are excellent and their version has been the definitive this past fifty years. Not a groner in the bunch.  Arrangement and accompaniment is beyond compare.  Technically excellent.  While it takes awhile to get me in dance mode, each song foretells the coming rock n rock era. Never fails to put me in a good mode. I usually get in the mode along about Dragnet.  Bought it used, and was as advertized; like new.  Arrived on time, well packaged.",1

"Word of mouth and buzz helped make ""Menopause"" a sleeper stage hit with middle-aged women.  This CD is mainly sold at the theatres that book the show on the nights they're on in the lobby.  This is the original cast (the usual case for this kind of release), so the end result can be different than of the actresses on the leg that perform in your area.  Don't expect a bunch of female Weird Als or ""Capitol Steps""/""SNL""/""Mad TV"" types.  The instrumentation is slightly amateurish, low budget, watered down, and weak.  For ""My Husband Sleeps Tonight"", a parody of the cringey oldie ""The Lion Sleeps Tonight"", no credit is given to Solomon Linda, whose family fought for his recognition and residuals.  Some parodies keep the same titles as the songs they lampoon, like Tina Turner's comeback ""What's Love Got to Do with It?"".  That almost defeats the purpose. Most men and younger women may not relate to the lyrics that Jeanie Linders wrote from experience.  They refer to symptoms like hot flashes, ageing, night sweats, cramps, insomnia, mood swings, restlessness, binge eating, weight gain, wobbly temper, becoming like their mothers; you name it!  Then again, maybe some things we all might get!  Because of the adult nature of these songs, I wouldn't play them around small children. For the UK edition, Iowa Housewife becomes Rutland Housewife (Rutland could refer to Eric Idle's ""Rutland Weekend Television"", which makes some sense here), and the ladies meet at Mohamed Al-Fayed's world famous department store Harrod's instead of New York City's Bloomingdale's, and there are other regional variations around the world in contrast to the America-centric flagship.  Hopefully, they'll all release their own editions. There have been two annual sold-out residencies to date in my town (and maybe yours as well), and it's always a rave.  Going to the show can't always be immortalised onto a studio recording.",1

Nice Patriotic music performed in a professional manner.  Good music that reminds you of great background for 4th of July firework or to just listen to.  I enjoy the 101 Strings Orchestra performances (especially for the price),1

"Sexyback is superwack to me. this song reminds me of a few tracks from back in the day. makes me think of Trent Rezinor's ""closer"" Meets Laidback's ""White horse"". Timberlake is trying to channel so much,but ends up forgetting the most important person in the song&that is himself.  a really flat track.",1
"The alumnus of the previously-manufactured and now-defunct N'Sync has returned with a follow-up to his hugely successful debut of 2003, Justified. While that effort shows promise, its slight disarray is sometimes jarring.  Now forward to 2006, the golden boy of music returns with first single Sexyback off FutureSex/LoveSounds. The single is an incredible piece of sweet funk, combining the sensuality of yesteryear's Prince and the deft execution of pre-scandal Michael jackson. With a hot salacious video to boot, the song is sure pop ecstasy.  At the helm of things is once again hip master Timbaland whose collaborations always bear edible fruits. Remixes of the song range from mediocre to superb, beginning with the lackadaisical Pokerface Club Mix which sounds like a piece of early 90's recycled house mix.  The slightly more varied Linus Loves Remix ups the ante with a more danceable electro beat. The best mix has to be the cool Tom Novy Ibiza Mix that cleverly uses a verse of Timberlake's sung vocals wrapped around some hypnotic and lackbaid grooves.",1
"When I first heard the title of this song, I thought he was singing about someone having a sexy backside. I didn't know he was singing about himself bringing sexy back, as if 'sexy' was ever gone! For real, this song is awful. It has no melody and is just plain emotionless. Justin Timberfake stated in an interview he was trying to bring back the sexiness of the 1980s. Well, he failed big time with this one.",1

"The self-titled release by the Atlanta based band, Theocracy first appeared in 2007 but has been out of circulation since that time.  For several months, fans have long-awaited for the release of Theocracy's original album - an album that has been remastered and remixed.  On November 19, fans around the were were thrilled to listen in to Matt Smith and the boys hammer out their unique style of Stryper meets Dream Theater heavy metal music.

Forced into the catacombs unite to praise the King of kings they fear a revolution and the power that He brings heaven's sons stand as one, as believers in the blood of Christ even in death we have true life  CENTURIES FLY BUT THE FLAME IS STILL ALIVE THE MAY HIDE IT, BUT IT WILL NEVER DIE CARVED IN OUR SOULS, SEE THE TWO HALVES OF THE SIGN THROUGH THE AGES HIS GLORY WILL ARISE FOR ALL TIME  The Serpent's Kiss begins as a ballad and speaks candidly about the curse of sin that has been inflicted on the cosmos.  Born into the darkness thrown into the viper's den the serpent in the cradle takes the child into its nest of sin slowly suffocating the souls of victims it has found into the vicious cycle on the path that only leads us down  Rat-race-fueled machinery this system of corruption have we become so cold and numb we're blind to its destruction? We're forging in the fires made of greed Our idols made of gold then bowing down before them with corrupt, adulterous souls opened eyes, realize...  WHAT WE HAVE DONE WHAT WE HAVE SEEN WHAT HAS BECOME OF OUR LIVES CORRUPTED OUR DREAMS WHAT WE HAVE LOST AND WHAT REMAINS PARALYZED BY THE VENOM THAT RUNS THROUGH OUR VEINS THERE'S GOT TO BE MUCH MORE TO LIFE THAN THIS THE WORLD'S CARESS IS JUST THE SERPENT'S KISS  But the venom that has plagued mankind has been defeated by the power of the cross.  So the song continues ...  I stand before you as a child by this world I've been defiled stained and poisoned, burned and beaten bruised and wounded, sick and vile with hands reaching out to you, I run realizing what I've done you take me in your arms, a reunited father and son...  The song is not only a powerful reminder of the gospel but also leaves listeners with a permanent and painful warning:  And all illusion ceases to exist the world's caress is just a serpent's kiss  Mountain paints a vivid portrait of the journey that every Christ-follower faces.  Step by step the climb gets harder my being weakens as I struggle farther and farther flesh is weakness, darkness, sickness my dreams are shattered, my ambitions crumbled my will defeated, my spirit humbled once more I am hopeless, helpless without you  The tune resembles John Bunyan's classic work, Pilgrim's Progress and leaves listeners with hope as they plod their way through the Christian life:  Take me to the places I can't go Transcending I'm sick of living in the status quo New Beginning And when it seems I've given up On eagle' wings you life me up again and this time I know, in the end ...You carried me  The title track, Theocracy is a metal dream that challenges every listener with the direct claims of Christ's lordship:  At the center of my heart there sits a throne That the rightful occupant's not always free to call His own For how can I give the King His place of worth above all else When I spend my time striving to place the crown upon myself?  The chorus hammers the lordship theme with a holy vengeance:  I TAKE MY CROWN AND CAST IT DOWN CASTLES BURNING CASTLES BURNING LEARN TO GROW, GROW TO BE A FLESH AND BLOOD THEOCRACY TO TAKE THE LOSS AND BEAR THE CROSS RAISE THE KINGDOM RAISE THE KINGDOM BURN AWAY ALL IVE BEEN TO RESURRECT THEOCRACY WITHIN  2 Corinthians 10:5 is employed to remind Christians to submit every thought to the lordship of Christ:  and the would-be rulers of my heart that I place upon the throne each lead the kingdom of my life to ruin to bring every though into submission to tear the idols down is to break the chains, to rearrange, to give the king his crown  The Healing Hand is a powerful five-part masterpiece that begins with the prophecy of the Messiah - the hope of nations.  The tune leads listeners from the cradle to the Cross of Christ where the ""healing hand becomes the bleeding hand.""  His kingdom forever, the Lion of Judah in strength everlasting redemption, atonement complete resurrected in power, as King now he stands FOR THE BLEEDING HAND HAS BECOME THE RULING HAND  Faith-born forever, a part of His kingdom become Or reject him, stand back and watch his kingdom come Alpha and omega almighty is he Christ reigns victorious for eternity Eternity  Several more songs grace this stunning album.  There is simply too much to share in a short review in this format.  But suffice it to say, this piece of work by Theocracy is about as good as it gets.  The music is tight, the production is crisp, and the vocals are spot on.  Again, as I have noted elsewhere, Matt Smith is one of the premier songwriters of this day.  For whatever reason, he has gone largely unnoticed - a tragedy in its own right.  This young man should be commended for his God-given gifts.  But as every God-fearing man recognizes, all the glory goes back to the Giver of every good gift.  Thanks to Matt Smith and the band for writing such God-honoring music; heavy metal music that truly honors the Lord Jesus Christ and magnifies his gospel!",1
"For those not familiar with the self-titled debut release, band founder Matt Smith composed all of the songs and performed all of the instruments (sans acoustic drums). Despite this deficiency the album was so well received that it became an instant classic and quickly went out of print. Fast forward to 2013, Theocracy has grown from 1 member to 5, released two stellar albums on Ulterium and the demand for a reissue/rerecording of the debut became a reality. As Smith points out in the updated liner notes the only thing new is a re mastering of the original recording with Shawn Bensons acoustic drums replacing the programmed drum sounds. These songs were already extremely good but now sound all that much more credible and powerful with a real timekeeper at the helm. Bensons style is well suited to the majority of this speedy power metal. And while he has clearly expanded upon the basic drum tracking, he has done so in a manner as to not disrupt the original flow of the music. Reissues rarely add much to the original  especially when the original was near perfect  but in this case these songs can now be heard the way they were originally meant to be recorded, transforming a classic of epic Christ-centric power metal into a masterpiece.",1
"Bonnie Pointer's First Solo Album is a classic waiting to be rediscovered. A varied album of different styles, all produced & performed so amazingly, it holds up well today. There is funk, Motown oldies, acoustic tracks, & a great orchestrated ballad. The music, the musicianship, and the vocals are all very creative and of the highest calibre.   Side One has 2 Motown oldies WHEN I'M GONE and HEAVEN MUST HAVE SENT YOU that are both done in the old Motown style. They even have legendary Motown bassist JAMES JAMERSON playing on them. This version of HEAVEN is five minutes and features scat singing by Bonnie in the middle. This is a different version from the disco hit single that went to #11 on the charts. Bonnie redid it as a single, and I much prefer the album version , with it's homage to classic Motown. The other 2 tracks are both stellar, with inventive arrangements, singing & playing. The single FREE ME FROM MY FREEDOM/TIE ME TO A TREE [ HANDCUFF ME ] is amazing. Pop/funk with Bonnie singing all the background vocals herself, and in the middle there is a banjo solo! That's what I mean about the creativity and work that Bonnie, the musicians and producer Jeffrey Bowen [ who previously produced The Temptations ] put into this album. And you have not heard a funk track as hot and funky as AH SHOOT, I guarantee you since Sly & The Family Stone's THANK YOU. This song is 5 minutes of pure funk nastiness with an organ that drives it, blazingly funky horns a/la James Brown, Bonnie's muti-faceted  vocals & just sheer musical genius at it's height. Outkast must have heard this track. It's just waiting to be sampled. The musicians on this album are of top calibre with Family Stone member TRUMAN THOMAS arranging, playing & co-writing , Funkadelic guitarist EDDIE HAZEL, Rolling Stones sideman OLLIE BROWN, original Motown bassist JAMES JAMERSON, NIGEL OLSSON of Elton John's band on one track, and string arrangements by noted arrangers LEE HOLDRIDGE and PAUL RISER.   And Side Two illustrates another side to Bonnie Pointer, with 4 acoustic rhythmically driven & played songs MORE AND MORE, I LOVE TO SING TO YOU, I WANNA MAKE IT [ IN YOUR WORLD ], and the beautiful ballad MY EVERYTHING that closes this unique, diverse album of sheer musical pleasure. These 4 numbers all co-written by DONALD BALDWIN are amazing - filled with hooks, catchy choruses, and pure musicianship. Remember Bonnie's solo on BLACK COFFEE from The Pointer Sisters 2nd album THAT'S A PLENTY. That is just a taste of what Bonnie can do with a ballad.   Also of note is that this self-titled album is the one with a RED COVER. For some unknown reason, Motown released Bonnie's 2nd album with the same self-titled name, and that has a purple cover. Also it's not as great as this one. Released in Dec. 1978, the same time as The Pointer Sisters equally excellent ENERGY album, this is a classic that has to be heard. It is by far the best of Bonnie's 3 solo albums. Catalog number is MOTOWN M7-911R1.   Tracks: WHEN I'M GONE, FREE ME FROM MY FREEDOM/TIE ME TO A TREE [HANDCUFF ME ], HEAVEN MUST HAVE SENT YOU, AH SHOOT, MORE AND MORE, I LOVE TO SING TO YOU, I WANNA MAKE IT [ IN YOUR WORLD ], MY EVERYTHING.   Released on MOTOWN M7-911RI, December 1978, Red Cover.",1
"For those who may not know this, there are actually 4 Pointer Sisters, not 3, but second-youngest Bonnie (born in 1950) broke away to pursue a solo career which began with this album for Motown. She had a couple of sizable hits from it with ""Heaven Must Have Sent You"" and ""Free Me From My Freedom"" both of which are great songs. However, as a whole, this album is not quite on par with late 70s Pointer Sisters material, as nothing else on the album quite measures up to the hits.",1
"I was all of 14 years old when I had this project on vinal, and I swan ... I wore the grooves off the album! It captured my musical mind back then and finding it on CD at last has been almost more than I can hadle! Every song is Motown production at it's best! While each song is perfection and I cannot pick out a 'best' I am partial to AH SHOOT; funky and bass driven ... it gets this white boy to dancin' like no white boy should!! Then there's I LOVE TO SING TO YOU ... a wonderful love song in itself, but Bonnie sings it so sweetly and simply that it amazes me. The original line up of songs ends with MY EVERYTHING ... another love song sung with total honesty ~ pure magic! The bonus tracks are the icing on an all ready perfect cake, and I am thrilled to have this back in my collection.",1
"I waited decades for this amazing album by Bonnie Pointer to be released on CD. It is such a highly unique album. The diversity of material and styles , combined with the level of original songs and musicianship make this one of the most stunning albums by a female artist. Side 1 with 2 original funk songs and 2 updates of lesser known Motown hits made a perfect side of an album when I bought it back on vinyl in 1979. The real big surprise was Side 2 with Bonnie singing 4 new original songs with acoustic guitars, layered vocals and a variety of instruments, like  California soul. Nobody else sounded like this. And all ending in the majestic "" MY EVERYTHING "" with beautiful orchestration. But I got a major shock, and am hugely disappointed. This reissue on CD does NOT have the original version of "" AH SHOOT "", but instead an alternate take! Unbelievable, but disappointingly true! Did someone not know that this was a totally different alternate version? The original is nowhere to be found. Instead we get this inferior version that was never released. If anyone knows this album, "" AH SHOOT "" is one of the funkiest songs ever recorded, with Eddie Hazel on guitar and Ollie Brown on drums, plus funky as Sly and James Brown horns and hammond organ, and Bonnie singing these stellar funk lyrics. Big Break Records could be re-named Big Blunder Records for this mistake. Where is the original version of this major funk opus??? I still have to play my original vinyl album to hear "" AH SHOOT "" the way it was released. What is the reason for this fiasco and why isn't the original on this release? Did anyone even know that this was an outtake? Big Break made a major screw-up with this mistake. I'd give the original album a 5 star rating, but because of this Big Break Blunder, their reissue screw-up deserves 1 star. Have someone who knows the original album listen to it before you make it on CD.",1
"It's encouraging to see that a batch of late-'70's and early-'80's albums have been newly (circa 2012) reissued on CD--by a label called BBR (Big Break Records).  ""Bonnie Pointer"" is the first one of them I've bought, because it contains one of my all-time favorite disco songs, ""Heaven Must Have Sent You"".  The original LP did not contain the disco version that eventually became a #11 pop and Top Ten Disco hit, but this reissue cures that by including both the 7"" and 12"" versions of it.  The other three bonus tracks are all versions of the record's first single, ""Free Me From My Freedom/Tie Me To a Tree (Handcuff Me)"".  The latter, which is not a medley by the way, has a very interesting lyric that seems to have caused the single to stall at mid-chart, at least on the pop side.  Some programmers & listeners felt it was either an S&M reference, or as the liner notes say, ""a step back for the feminist movement.""  It is open to either that interpretation or Bonnie's--that she meant to be tied and handcuffed with love, not literally, after finding independence to be disappointing.  ""Put love's chains back on me...""  The rest of the record covers a wide range of styles.  I think Bonnie sounds a lot like Carole King on ""More And More"" and I'm hearing some Billie Holliday in ""My Everything"".  Another Motown remake (besides ""Heaven Must Have Sent You"", originally a hit for the Elgins) begins the album:  ""When I'm Gone"" is a (literally) snappy version of the Brenda Holloway classic.  I wouldn't say the sound is ""muddy"" as another reviewer put it, but I can't say it leaps out of the speakers either.  I'd be curious to hear/read what other buyers think about this.  On the plus side, the packaging is excellent, with great photos and an extensive essay by Christian John Wikane.  The notes give a brief history of the Pointer Sisters before (thoroughly) discussing the making of this album.  More about ""Heaven"":  it opens with a machine gun drum blast, has the guitar jangling all the way through, features a 2-minute wild string-and-drum break, and ends with Ms. Pointer channeling Louis Armstrong.  One of the most amazing disco productions ever!",1
"For those who grew up during the 70s like me or those who are just fans of the period The Pointer Sisters are infamous.  Bonnie Pointer was the creative force behind the original quartet and after years of huge success she broke from the group in 1976 and joined Motown.  Her first release was this gorgeous recording with the glorious red cover, her beautiful face and simply titled BONNIE POINTER.  Side one had the uptempo tracks and side two was more reflective.  There are glorious covers of WHEN I'M GONE and HEAVEN MUST HAVE SENT YOU. The Motown sound was again loud and strong.  But Bonnie also brought FREE ME FROM MY FREEDOM a disco track with much funk and AH SHOOT.  The second side totally shined with emotional standouts MORE AND MORE and MY EVERYTHING.  Raw and emotional, Bonnie gave her all.  The album was a huge success and then HEAVEN MUST HAVE SENT YOU was released as a disco track and it roared up all the charts and became a disco/dance/soul/r&b classic.  It also brought even more attention to the amazing album.  Here BBR has done their magic and brought this superb release to life with beautiful and glorious remastering.  The sound is amazing.  What a gift.  And then we get 5 bonus tracks and a huge booklet of pictures and extensive liner notes.  If this release brings back memories it has never sounded better.  I highly recommend it to fans of soul/disco/r&b as well as fans of the 70s.  And a huge thanks to BBR.  You are reuniting listeners to the true music classics the way they were meant to be heard.  Don't hesitate to purchase this.  The crystal clear sound of Bonnie's pure vocals will pull you in from beginning to end.",1
"I was living in a small apartment in Ceiba, Puerto Rico, the year this album hit the shelves. Heaven Must Have Sent You, both in English and Spanish, rocked every juke box on the island. Radio Mart, broadcasting from Cuba, had the Caribbean airways poppin'.",1
"Bonnie Pointer made two solo albums for Motown and both were called BONNIE POINTER. One has her picture of her head with earrings on a red background, the other has a picture of her head with flowers in her hair on a blue background. (I call them the RED or the BLUE albums). There is different music on each, the blue has a few covers of older (mostly Mowtown)music, like JIMMY MACK. The track listing for this RED album is: 1: WHEN I'M GONE, 2: FREE ME FROM MY FREEDOM, 3: HEAVEN MUST HAVE SENT YOU, 4: AH SHOOT, 5: MORE AND MORE, 6: I LOVE TO SING TO YOU, 7: I WANNA MAKE IT (IN YOUR WORLD), 8: MY EVERTHING. / The song HEAVEN MUST HAVE SENT YOU was a single, it was even released as a ""Disco Single Remix"" with a longer disco sound. I've owned both the Red and Blue albums and I personally think the Red album is the better album.",1
"The 2nd solo album from BONNIE POINTER is another self-titled album title, which features mostly remakes of Motown oldies, featuring a purple cover with a drawing of her. Ultimately, it is not as rewarding as her excellent 1st solo album released just one year prior to this that has a red cover. I don't know why the decision was to redo more old Motown songs from the 60's , whether it was her decision, producer Jeffrey Bowen or Motown . Only 6 songs, with only 1 song being an original new song, DEEP IN MY SOUL, which is excellent! It is a ballad much in the vein of the inventive tunes on her 1st album. It's what this album should have contained more of - original music.   As for the other 5 songs, I guess since HEAVEN MUST HAVE SENT YOU was a big hit, they combed the Motown catalog for more classics to redo. It's far too many to have done. What should have been a step forward in doing more progressive music like on her 1st album, was instead a fatal error that pretty much ended her solo career. This easily could have been an EP, and probably should have been only that, not a 2nd full album of remakes. Of these I CAN'T HELP MYSELF , JIMMY MACK, WHEN THE LOVELIGHT STARTS SHINING THROUGH HIS EYES are the best. The arrangements are at least new & different than the original versions. But really, how could she top the original versions. It's a case of overdoing it. Even the presence of SLY STONE and FREDDIE STEWART paying on 2 songs doesn't add up to much, as well as OLLIE E. BROWN, TRUMAN THOMAS and NATHAN EAST - all top session men. I once read that there were more recordings done for her 2nd album, but they were shelved in place of this. Grave error. This could have advanced Bonnie's career had it been filled with great songs like her 1st. And why name it BONNIE POINTER like the 1st? All it has done is confuse people.   So, if you like Bonnie's singing, and she sings great on here, or Motown oldies remade, you'll like this. Otherwise, get her 1st slo album - it IS amazing. Bonnie ledt Motown after this album, and recorded one more solo album, IF THE PRICE IS RIGHT, in 1984 for the Private I label. That is better than this album, features all original songs, and even has Ruth & Anita singing background vocals on 2 songs. The Pointer Sisters , of course, were now platinum recording artists with a string of hit singles and albums . A shame she won't be let back into the group, but since she left in 1978, that was it for her with her sisters as a group.   Released in late 1979 on MOTOWN M7-929R1 with the purple cover. Songs: I CAN'T HELP MYSELF, JIMMY MACK, WHEN THE LOVELIGHT STARTS SHINING THROUGH HIS EYES, DEEP INSIDE MY SOUL, COME SEE ABOUT ME, NOWHERE TO RUN.",1
"This 2 CD set contains 61 tracks many released for the first time and others only found on very limited edition vinyl. The producer, Bob Celli together with Bobby Vee's family have done an absolutely exceptional job in remastering the various tracks - Bobby Vee never sounded so good! The stereo is lush, the definition superb. ""Party Doll"" with the Crickets, an unreleased track from the 1962 album and ""Gone"" (which was apparently an atrociously sounding 45 due to a mastering problem) are wonderful. If, as gas prices top $4.00 and the economy flounders you need a trip back to the 60s in technicolor stereo - this is a must have set. One issue, Amazon lists a digital download in addition to the 2CDs - there is no info on this in the package.",1

"Please know that this is a pirate release.  Rarities UK or US was never on CD.  These tracks are on official CDs now, especially Past Masters (the same reason Hey Jude/The Beatles Again isn't on CD either).  MFSL sure didn't release this (theres also a fake MFSL pirate of Abbey Road mono). When the original UK LP was released in 1978 (I have a continental copy), most of these tracks were never on an album there before.  These classics are generally well known among the fans.  This is more for completists really. I wouldn't mind getting the edition which is combined with Let It Be.  If I do come across this one, and it's not too much, I'd probably buy it.",1

Some good music from the past that gets only light current radio play (I haven't heard the Knack since they burned brightly and faded just as quickly).  And most of these won't get much play 30 years from now so owning this set is an affordable way to get 25 chart-quality songs not heard much today.,1
Songs that are familiar but don't get alot of regular airplay. Worth price and no issues w songs. Happy w purchase!,1
Wanted music to exercise to. This is a good album for that.,1
love his music and I will be purchasing more in the near future as long as my wife lets me order,1
"Another great song by Charley Pride.  I love the song, it has such a good upbeat message and he has a good voice.",1
"Charley's voice is incredible, he is truly a country legend though he doesn't get as much recognition as he should! This is his biggest hit, take a listen and you'll be an instant fan.",1
I like this song and love Allison's voice. It is haunting and moving and powerful. She sings the song as though she is trying to convey a serious message and I am on the verge of understanding the message. I recommend this song.,1
"This is a great song and I have downloaded several copies.  It has been done by practically everybody from rock bands to opera singers and there is something to say for all.  The lyrics are stunning - it is a very sad love song.  The singer or chorus who does it needs quite a range.  It needs to be belted out, not whispered with the help of electronic equipment.  I liked Allison Crowe's renditon.  Bon Jovi does a good job, as does Jason Castro,the Canadian Tenors, and Brandi Carlile.",1
"Crow does a decent job on this song, my recent favorite lyrics.  Gives it a strong clear sound and image.",1
THIS MUSIC IS NICE. I MEAN WHAT MORE CAN I SAY. EVERYTHING IS JUST THERE WHEN IT COMES TO QUALITY & VIBE.,1
"This is one of those songs that takes you back to a really talented period in Popular music. The singing and bass line in this song really are amazing and incredible! A great, timeless classic that I like to listen to using the Amazon cloud player.",1
The lyrics and melody to this song mean as much in 2013 as they did in the 70's when it was released.,1
Excellent song. Love It much!!  Would recommend it to R&B lovers everywhere.  Really good price for for one great song.,1
"Nice voice, nice group. One of the best of all time. Miss them so much. I wish they were here now singing all of the hits.",1
Love this song and Great memories from my teen years..  Can listen to this over and over again Thank you,1
This song is one of the greatest songs ever. They don't write music like this anymore. All they have now is rap and rock music that is dark and dreary. truly a feel good tune with simple lyrics. I am biased but I love the vibes by the man Vince Montana Jr. he is the Philly sound.  This song takes me to another place another time. truly beautiful music that will live on forever at weddings and many other places. I love the sitar sounding guitar.,1
This song brought back memories from when I was a teenager. Definetly a great song and they sing it well.,1
Latoya Luckette sampled this song in one of hers and I just wanted the original. I like the vibe of this song.,1

"The Stylistics  are one of my favorite groups. There is so much feeling in their music, and it brings out the best of your feelings.",1
This song is a sweet song. I have no complaints. I just like it. It makes you feel good when you hear it.,1
"Growing up, I was raised on all kinds of music, none of it Motown. But secretly, I loved the stuff, and would listen to it and sing to it all the time. And now, today, I sing at various bars and restaurants with a predominantly country audience (simply because that's the area where I live -- out in the country!) And whenever I sing a Motown classic, like Stevie Wonder's ""Superstition,"" I see feet and hands a tappin' to the beat! But when I do ""You Make Me Feel Brand New"" by the Stylistics (because, yes. I can sing both the low and the high parts myself,) people start slow dancing. And I get all kinds of compliments. If you can pull it off vocally, then you really owe it to your audience, and to yourself, to share this wonderful love ballad with the world.",1
Love this song and Great memories from my teen years..  Can listen to this over and over again Thank you,1
This is the best a collection of their greatest hits Many great songs brings back lots of memories. If you love the 70s youll love this,1
The Stylistics music will always be excellent music to do just about everything to. They have a style that is both unique and unforgettable.,1
If you ever want to make out with a chick put this on. They don't write music like this anymore. All they have now is rap and rock music that is dark and dreary. truly a feel good tune with simple lyrics. I am biased but I love the vibes by the man Vince Montana Jr. he is the Philly sound.  This song takes me to another place another time. truly beautiful music from a  simpler time.,1

Love this song and Great memories from my teen years..  Can listen to this over and over again Thank you,1
"This is the version of Betcha By Golly, Wow that I heard as a kid back in the late 1960's and very early 1970's. This song brings back many memories for me of the girls that I really liked back then. I like nearly all of the songs that were done by the Stylistics. If you like mellow music then you would like this song.  Mike Serovey, MA, MISM Owner of Mike Serovey Reviews",1
Another classic by the stylistics.  I love their music and in one way or another you can relate to the songs,1
The Stylistics music will always be excellent music to do just about everything to. They have a style that is both unique and unforgettable.,1
I know the artist Prince has done this song but it's nothing like hearing the original from time to time.,1
I do not write revews for single mp3's  I do not write revews for single mp3's I do not write revews for single mp3's,1
With the music out there now its nice to listen to words that aren't bleeped out  on TV or screamed or rapped  to some weird beat. Im tired of not being able to understand or having to turn things down all the time. The Stylistics are smooth and easy  without being boring. Its my kind of music,1
Love this song and Great memories from my teen years..  Can listen to this over and over again Thank you,1
Who hasn't broke up to eventually make up just to break up again?  The Stylistics hit the nail on the head with this song,1
The Stylistics music will always be excellent music to do just about everything to. They have a style that is both unique and unforgettable.,1
"Beautiful song, nostalgic, puts me right back in the 1970's.  Very easy to sing along with, if you need to cheer up about your quarrel with your loved one, this is your song!",1
I had forgotten JAVA but I downloaded it anyway and I'm glad I did. It's a simple tune but it's lots of fun.,1
A great song that I heard at a friends house a couple of time and had to add it to my collection.,1
"I used this to help familiarize myself with this great composition. I love it, and would buy it again if I lost it.",1
"This is the song that I walked in to during my wedding... On the video I can hear him respond when he saw me.... Priceless....  Now when I hear this song, it brings back the smile that I have held on to since the day that I married my wonderful husband!",1
"Listening to this piece is relaxing an allows you to be at easy not being all stressed out, great song.",1
I've been thru a lot and this song sums up my life's travels.,1
I first heard it on Charter's Music Choice dance channel.  Cool dance song and love the Howard Jones sample.  On my dance and party songs playlists.,1
Always loved this song and the new spin with Cedric Gervais makes it fun to listen to all over again!,1
Tracked this song down finally.  I'm collecting all my favorite oldies as well as some newer songs.  The list is over 100 already!,1
"One thing you have to give Howard Jones, even his most depressing break-up songs are penned with sunshine.  Things Can Only Get Better (1985) is one of those forgotten mid-80's gems you throw in a mix and everybody loves.  It has a very 80's synth-vibe and an ""oh-wow-wow"" that is highly reminiscent of the following year's Bon Jovi smash&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Livin-On-A-Prayer/dp/B000V66VYC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Livin' On A Prayer</a>.",1
"IM digging it babe ... cream cheese and chives and onions and AWESOME-ness . . . can U dig it mofo, yaayayayaya !!!!!!!!!!!",1
Sure to melt resistance! This song could sweep a lady of her feet and put her in the mood! Smooth!,1
"One of my all time oldies...just love it!  If you're looking for a good love song, this is the one!",1
This was a story telling song about a man wanting to be next to a beautiful woman. From the movie Car Wash. Great film and song.,1
"A great song from a classic movie. The only song I really liked from the movie, so I had to have it.",1
"The movie, the music all classic, for the lover in you.  Spending my dimes wasting my time, talking till I am black and blue, I wanna get next to you.  No disrespect just love and music.",1
This song is so strange and the innuendos would make most hair metal bands blush but this damn thing sticks in your head for the rest of the day.,1
This is a very nice song. Well performed by Nancy and Lee. It was one of my favorites for the year 1966. I love it. The sound is good.,1
Great 60's song by the artists who originally made it great.,1
I enjoy all the songs I purchase from Amazon for my Kindle.  The qualitiy of these songs are wonderful.,1
I can listen to this song repeatedly and not get tired of it.  This is a fantastic song written by Lee Hazlewood that is perfectly sung by him and Nancy Sinatra.  He has the classic cowboy voice and Nancy Sinatra has that smooth and silky voice.,1
"I had not heard this song before, and just happened to stumble across it on Youtube.  It's very pretty and I love listening to it.  Once again, I'm learning to play it on my ukulele.",1
"I was watching a movie the other day, can't remember the name of the movie, and a couple was in the living room kinda making eyes at each other and all that.  Anyway this song was playing in the back ground of the scene.  And then I remembered what a great song.  Some Velvet Morning is also a great song.  You have the soft voice of Nancy...and the deep gravely voice of Lee.",1
"I love music, downloads great, nice song and have a lot of  other songs by this artist, am a music lover.",1
"This song caught me off-guard when I heard it in the soundtrack for the movie ""Stoker.""  The film had plenty of good songs, but this old cover song is my favorite. Very sexy.",1
"""This is the song for people who are the workers and not the employees."" Everytime I listened to this music, I am proud to be a worker. This song is now part of my music library.",1
In this classic rocker we are treated to a driving beat intertwined with soaring lyrics. Musically it is a fusion of early 70s rock with strong Motown flourishes such as ample use of fuzz and wa-wa on the guitars with lively choral back-up on the vocals. The lyrics are upbeat as was typical of the era. It makes you smile and wish more music of today could impart such a good feeling. There is some really great drumming throughout.,1
This is my favorite song from Rare Earth. In my view it captures the best in Rare Earth's unique sound and energy.,1
It was so fun to hear this song at our 40th Class reunion.  Being able to download song to iPhone was easy.,1
I have always liked this song. Love the beat and the lirics! It's one of my favorites forever! Super jam!!,1
"The  fact that songs such as this are still available confers a degree of merit, I suppose.  I purchased this along with about thirty others from the period because I was sitting around feeling nostalgic for my youth and the days I shared with some friends in a band in Detroit (EVERYone in Detroit in the sixties was in a band).  Gloria, Midnight hour, old Stones favorites -- these were the elements of our playlists.  The three-chord simplicity of these old tunes seemed a refreshing reshaping of the blues that gave birth to them. It's been great listening to this and the others I purchased along with it. The only thing remarkable about this group and those like it is that the guys only had one hit in them.",1
. Another great old song from long ago that is on my Sansa fuze to enjoy daily at work. The old songs when music was great,1
song from my Flower child days and still better than 98% of the cr*p that is being dumped on today's music market,1
I remember loving this song as a kid. I didn't know it was her that sang it. I would recommend it.,1
love love love this song gald to have it back and on my mp3 player listen to it all the time,1
"It's a decent song with a good beat.  I like music with a good, fast rhythm and good lyrics.  This fits.",1
I couldn't find this song in other website but found it in amazon.com. It was for my wife and she liked it. So I'm happy with it too.,1
"I really miss great groups like Santo & Johnny, they took the sound of music to another level which all of us back than just couldn't get enough of.",1
I really love the harmonization Frank and Nancy did on this too. It is clear and a very good song. I thank the person who put this up.,1
Recommend to all my friends. I like it but don't have 12 words for it so I am really babbling.,1
"Do you guys remember Art Bell when he hosted the radio show ""Coast to Coast""?  He had some great bumper music and this song was one of them.  Very Haunting.",1
"What got me caught on this song was hearing a remake from the Webb Brothers. The remake took the best aspects of the song and gave it a updated polish. All that means is the original, while sounding dated, still holds both a unique and familiar feel to it. The song has two different parts to it. These parts are completely different from each other in just about all things. The feel, groove and even time signature are different. The first part is very much a forward moving and brooding feel to it reminiscent of the old western films. The other part switches to a 3/4 time signature with Nancy Sinatra singing softly about nature. Both sides seem to switch back in forth in either a dance or a duo between each other. Kind of a one side masculine and one feminine.  Much has been said about the meaning of the song and lyrics. The obvious is one part is a man who was influenced by somebody named Phaedra, and the other is Phaedra herself speaking of what she is all about. Is it all about romance? Is it about evolving to a higher sense of being? Is it just about sex? I found no definitive answers out there. I like to think it's about redemption given to somebody hardened by life by one who is at one with her surroundings.  It's such a simple song yet it is filled with complexity not just in lyrics but musically as well. It's been covered many times, but I find going back to the original keeps me in touch with just how beautiful the song is in both its darker and warmer tones. If you like 60's psychedelic music they don't get much better than this.",1
Like most folks I heard this song in Kill Bill and was very curious who sung it and the like. I really like the guitar on this and how it accents with the lyrics. Its a good one for 99 cents.,1
"Nancy Sinatra at her best. Slow, sultry song with memorable lyrics, what more could one ask for? Typically of 60s songs and more ballad than rock. A must have for any Nancy fan.",1
...Cher or Nancy Sinatra.  But it was Nancy Sinatra's version of Bang Bang that was used in the movie Kill Bill.,1
One of the many songs that affected my life in a positive manner.,1
"I never get tired of listening to this music, reminiscent of a more innocent time. Wish I was back there",1
"This edition is just as I heard it on the radio growing up.  The lyrics are still powerful and well-phrased, the vocals still include harmonizing falsetto (which I cannot stand normally, but these guys did it perfectly), and the guitar work still has the slightly metallic electric guitar sound of classic rock.  Have to love it.",1
This was one of many that made it through the 70's and touched peoples hearts as they were growing up. I've loved this group all through school. Giving away my age but music is not the same anymore!,1
great song from a great era of music brings back lots of memories of my childhood great band who had some good songs,1
this was a hard rockin song and the band that did it was one i had to get used to but it was a nice add on to my player .,1
"Great Song. An anthem, This song is the meaning of heavy metal.",1
"This was one of my favorite tunes, back in 1966. Nancy does a real good job performing this peppy song. I just love it. The MP3 sound is quite satisfactory.",1
"I've always liked this tune but its really a short run-time  Reminds me of the movie Full Metal Jacket, this tune is played about midway thru the video.",1
These Boots Are Made For Walkin by Nancy Sinatra is a bold pop song about a singer expressing in an assertive way of what she plans on doing with her boots. The music to the song is also well-timed with when she expresses with the lyrics how one of these days her boots are going to etc. etc.,1
Exactly what I was looking for.  This is the version I remembered.,1
"I heard Jessica Simpson (I think) sing this and really wanted to hear the Nancy Sinatra version I heard as a kid, which I think sounds better.",1
"WHAT'Z TO SAY. IT'Z A SONG D/LOAD AND IT PLAYED FINE, FULL LENGTH...",1
This song brings back such memories. I actually think this is the first song I ever paid attention too as a very young kid! Nice to find these old gems on Amazon!,1
"LOVE OLD TIME MUSIC I AM WHAT IS CALLED A BABY BOOMER ,GOOD SOUND QUALITY USED TO MAKE SOME FAMILY MOVIES WITH FOR MEMORIES",1
The only song with a real beat.  Still hooks me every time.,1
This is a much better copy you have in store! The first one I had shared online years ago either went viral or no longer fits well in my iTunes library. But now I have this copy in my iPod! Thanks so much!,1
I enjoy all the songs I purchase from Amazon for my Kindle.  The qualitiy of these songs are wonderful.,1
"I loved the 1960's the songs were so strong and almost militant by standards of the day.  In the backdrop of the times These Boots Are Made For Walkin' was one of the rallying cries of women fed up with the traditional roles of homemaker and mommy.  These Boots Are Made For Walkin' was more than a song it was a metaphor that spoke to empowerment of the so called weaker sex.  More than just a woman's rallying cry this was a darn good song too.  This song like so many others is a joyful part of my 1960's era childhood.  In 2014 its fun to look back into the world now long gone.  Sometimes when I listen to these songs like These Boots Are Made For Walkin' I remember listening to the car radio, the memory is sometimes so vivid can almost smell the Ford Fairlane 500 that was our family car.",1
"When Frank Sinatra have kids, they all follow in his footsteps and make it in the entertainment business.  Nancy Sinatra is talented in her singing style of telling a story of  what is going to happen.  The song have great melody and lyrics!",1
"Four stars because it is 60s ballad music. Though this is an iconic classic and has much more rock and roll sounds than many of her other songs, it still is a Sinatra ballad. A must have for any Sinatra collection.",1
Love the music great beat. Sometimes I Sing along. I would recommend this to anyone and I hope they like it like I do,1
This song never ever ever gets old.  One of the best old songs to listen to even now in 2013.,1
. Another great old song from long ago that is on my Sansa fuze to enjoy daily at work. The old songs when music was great,1
This is one of the songs that I like the most of Nancy Sinatra; quality never desapoints doesn't matter how many years ago the song was recorded,1
"Not sure why but listening to it today it doesn't have that sound that I heard when I was kid. I heard it on the oldies but goodies station when I was maybe 10 or 12; and I thought it had a great beat. Listening to Sinatra's voice today as an adult, though I notice that she doesn't seem to have much of a singing voice. The beat is still good but something's not quite right.  It's a good song.",1
Another great old song from long ago that is on my Sansa fuze to enjoy daily at work. The old songs when music was great.,1
"My dad was feeling nostalgic and wanted me to download this song, who knew country Kenny Rogers sang trippy music",1
Another of my favorite Kenny Rogers & The First Edition songs.,1
"For folks who only know K. Rogers as a ""Country"" artist...Take a listen to his foray into Psychedelic Rock in the 60's!  Great Stuff!",1
It brings back memories of my youth.  I'm 59 years old.  Rogers had quite a range back then.  Who knew that he would become such a huge country star.,1
A lot of people don't realize before Kenny Rogers went country he was one of the 60's Hippy movement. This is a really great album and the song is a favorite of all those that dropped out and tuned in.,1
to believe that this song was done by Kenny Rogers about a bad trip that he and the First Edition had. At least that is what he said in a Playboy interview shortly after they did this song but it still is a Great song from a bygone era.,1
"I grew up listening to these guys, not realizing back then what a great set of vocals the Kenny Rogers had. A great song and a timeless classic!!",1
"Iris DeMent has a really great voice, she does a very haunting rendition of Leaning On The Everlasting Arms",1
"This song made the movie, True Grit.  I hope the audience truly gave this great hymn some thought.  The everlasting arms of God are always there is reach us and take us to a secure place with Christ.",1
"i love this, i was really affected on how they used this in the theme music for true grit, a story about a girl who is brave and lives by leaning on the Everlasting Arms even in danger....",1
"was experimenting with music downloads to my kindle, don't plan to download too many songs there, did a few old favorites",1
Great song from 1968 by the Turtles. This has a popular hit on the radio and it holds up well after all these years.,1
"downloaded to my kindle, sounds ok on the kindle, but prefer it on my MP3 to take with me ..",1
"Loved this song first time I heard it decades ago and still love it. 5 stars from me, but since music tastes are so subjective, make sure you listen to the audio clip before you buy it.",1
It's the music and artist I wanted... so of course it's a good review.,1
This song in some cities was banned by the right wing Nazi's in the 60's,1
I had to include this in a CD I made as a 60's woman.,1
I had to download this song. It brings back so many memories,1
"Great song, many memories, it's a classic!  Just love the tune, and I realized I should opt to buy it, hot wait to chance hearing it again, on the oldies station!",1
"I love this song and use it as a ring tone for someone named...You got it, Louie.  The beginning of the song fits perfectly where it needs to.",1
"I've always loved this song since i was a kid.  It's timeless.  Play it for your honey, or sing it to her!",1
"I don't even bother to listen to anyone else do this song. It will forever be etched into happy memories of my younger days.  Yes, the lyrics are simple and repetitive and the music, well, kinda silly, but I love the sentiment and the joy it brings.",1
"I loved this back in the 60's,and still love in today.""I can't see me lovin' nobody but you for all my life."" Can it be any clearer or dearer?? No. It can't. So put the top down,hook up your iPod,set it to this song,and you and your honey sing away like the kids you used to be,and still are. Thankfully.",1
The most beautiful love song I've ever heard. Pleasant and easy to listen to. I've added it to several play lists.,1
"It's a song track.  I like it, I wanted it, I bought it.  It is a quick way to get a single you want.  I use these as practice aids for band work.  The MP3 format is not optimum for real listening enjoyment.  In order to compress the data, a lot of tones are left out.  Even a good cassette tape outperforms this storage medium.  But it has its uses, and is inexpensive.",1
"Heard this song on the Michael Berry Radio Show, and had to buy it! It's kinda a redneck love song.",1
Heard this at the end of a movie but never listened to it.,1
"Flo and Eddie may have had a dark side when the played with Zappa, but this ain't it. This is a classic song remastered to sound good in the digital age.",1
This is a definitive '60s song with one of the more memorable vocal chorus/harmonies from that era. A great song with that  classic '60s sound and feel :),1
This song brings back great memories of my younger days when making a public phone call only cost a dime.,1
I really like this song a lot.  It's got just the right blend of a catchy tune with good music.  Like this one a lot!  And there's a hilarious video with this piece on YouTube.,1
"This is a great song.  The lyrics are super, and the tune is one of those that is going to stay in your mind for a while.  If you want to feel happy and carefree, this is a song that will probably work in that wonderful way for you.  It's a beautiful song with great vocal, great lyrics, and a wonderfully happy tune.",1
"A great 60's teen love song! Well done, with good sound production. Great band.",1
"People who work are expected to take part in the kind of mechanism without magic that avoids anything that is going on in this song. As personalities in a fog, we always sense an iceberg approaching at ramming speed. The key for me is she thinks crossing her legs is funny. This song works with a man and a woman singing about each other. The combination is a big door prize. There are ups and downs:  He ain't been laid in a month of Sundays. I caught him once and he was sniffing my undies.  Intellectual involution is only aroused when magic makes whatever comes next far more interesting than what we have observed so far. The secrets that work for circus stunts, religion, philosophy, and the usual cosmic pogo stick ups keep our scrambled eggs all runny.",1
I purchased this and many other love songs from Amazon for a romantic mix CD I made for my husband.,1
"Great Song, what can I say... I needed that song for a party and it was easy to get, just downloaded it.",1
It was played at my Sister Wedding and at mine. It is one of the best songs that the Turtles did.,1
I grew up in the 60's & 70's so this is the kind of music I enjoy.  Good Memories here,1
"Sounds great.  A classic tune and aside from choosing ""how is the weather"" as the rhyme for ""so happy together"" a great song.",1
"Good song! I am always looking for a good song that fits my emotional needs, and one that I can easily put on repeat. Otherwise, I wouldn't have purchased it.",1
This song takes me back to my listening youth. They are great at taking people home to a better time then nowadays. Very happy with all the transaction.,1
"Grew up listening to my Dad sing this song to my Mom. Always makes me smile. It's a sweet, upbeat song you can dance to.",1
"Just as good as when I listened to the song in the 60's. If you are from the 60's, you will love this song.",1
"It is really nice to hear a song that you can sing along with.  A song that has words that make since.  A song that isn't vulgar.  If you like that kind of music, this is for you.",1
Amazing!  Absolutely amazing...they nailed it.  Worth every penny (although I'm not suggesting in ANY way that any of the companies that sell music online should start charging more)!!,1
"I like a lot of the songs the Turtles did back then but this one is border line bubble gum. Not that it's bad, it isn't. Actually a good tune.",1
"I grew up with Turtles music, I never tired of it, I will always enjoy their music, every song. Great!",1
Another Master of entertainment we shall never ever forget. Inspiring and delightful. Makes you smile every time you hear him and ashamed of how you concern yourself with your own meager problems when you remember how he overcame so much at that time.,1
"Once again, I heard this song in the film ""Ray"" and remembered my parents playing it at home. 2 thumbs up!",1
Great oldie classic that is sure to remind you of when you were young(er)!  This is the shorter version of his recording.  I recommend it.,1
"I agree with James - the sound quality is not up to par, though a great song. However, the master tape was found at a NJ flea-mart and stored in a basement, so it's understandable about the sound quality. The original 45 or album will sound better.",1
"Rock, Funk maybe? If you're +/- 40-years old, and don't recognize the title, you'll recognize the melody.",1
"This is the original re-issue of the song as is the subpar mastering, sorry. The song should have been remastered to corrospond with the digital era.",1
This immediately went intro my favorites collection and will get many plays! Not a big follower of the rest of their stuff.,1
"This was one of those unexpected songs from the 70's, from a band that we didn't know much about.  They had a great style which comes through very clearly in this song.  It's great to find songs like this to listen to again.",1
Funny thing is... I fell in love with this song courtesy of Tyler Perry's I Can Do Bad By Myself movie. Yip. This is definitely a pick me up song.,1
"My cousin was singing this song so I had to get plus I heard this song on ""I could do bad all by myself"" but I wish the sound track was out but I love this song.",1
The song I downloaded is more of a single vocal with a guitar background. I remembered it being more melodic and with some harmony. My memory is bad or there is another version of the song I missed.,1
"Who doesn't know this song? If you are a rocker and you haven't heard it, you need to get more education. MP were one of the forerunners and should be in every collection",1
"This is an updated version of the song that defined Mason Proffit in the early 1970s. It is still musically beautiful, and the changed lyrics reflect less of the conflict between the counter-culture and the ""straight"" world, but rather, somewhat more universal concepts of justice and truth (and at what price they can be achieved).",1
"Mr. Desmond's voice was just so unusual and so unforgettable.  This was just a great song, no matter what kind of music you like.",1
combo of Reggae with a bit of hip hop - makes you happy to listen to it;  course its not a new song but there are so many that remain current and classic and this is one,1
The great thing about the internet is that it allows me to rediscover songs from my past.  I never knew who sang this song until I found it on You Tube.,1
"Christmas jeer -- I mean cheer -- is all the rage!  I figured I would do my part for the retail industry and their obsession for Christmas in July and do a review on this tune appropriately -- in July. This sketch ranks up their with ""A Christmas Story"" and Ralphie along with his Red Rider BB gun with the Compass in the Stock/Stalk (who knows???) as being American classics.  This song is an undying testimony to America's obsessive nature with parody and an unrelenting need to kick back and say ""to hell with being up-tight"" and with good reason - stress is the killer (Fantasia and a white bat or something, anyway...) and life is not all that serious as it is irony based. It doesn't come as a surprise as to why the fine line between becoming productive or postal rests somewhere in letting go for a moment. Unfortunately, I know these things.  Enjoy!",1
"""Grandma Got Run Over By a Reindeer"" is Dr. Emo's (yes, he really is a doctor) signature hit, that has gone down in history as becoming one of the most ludicrous modern X-Mas songs in recent history. The reason why I listen to this song almost everyday during Christmastime is because it's so funny and over-the-top. It's really a very tragic song (at least the lyrics are) but it's sung to sound funny and even rather screwballish. I remember there was a music-video made for it that VH1 used to show during Christmastime. My favorite part of the song is when Dr. Elmo asks deadpan: should we open up her gifts or send them back? It can't get more theatrical than that",1
Always like that song at Christmas. It puts so much fun in this time of year. You just sit and laugh all through the song.,1
Came on time and as expected. Love this song during Christmas! Worked great.,1
I was missing the old christmas carrols I grew up on.  These brought back so many delightful childhood memories for me.  I was lucky to find them by the original recording artists,1
I played this song on Piano for a Christmas concert one year in High School and when I heard it on the radio one day it brought back memories.  My 6 year old son loves it and wants it played over and over. He thinks its hilarious!,1
Awesome. Loved it. What would Christmas be without this hilarious song??? I always catch myself singing it starting in early November.,1
Very nice job on this song ! Love the horn lines !,1
"Great song, don't listen to when going through a breakup could induce temporary drinking...lol. I would recommend a listen though.",1
"I had never heard of this singer prior to seeing this free MP3.  I am a fan of blues-style music so the preview sounded good to me and I am glad I downloaded it.  It features some nice guitar playing and singing, but the lyrics are rather simple.  I admit I like the kind of lyrics that break your heart (probably why I like the blues so much) and this isn't telling that kind of a story - the lyrics are a little too simple for that, but it does have a very nice sound with nice guitar riffs.",1
"Having served in the Marines I've heard this done by bands all over the country and world.  This was free on Veterans day, so I grabbed it.",1
Very good download. It met my immediate needs. The rest of this is just filler to satisfy the review word count.,1
"AWESOME song! Well done, perfect in so many ways. Hard not to like, do not wait, get this while you can.",1
Its ok. I just got it because it was free on veterans day. Its just not the type of music I listen to.,1
I downloaded this for my nursing home residents to enjoy. They thought it was wonderful and it brought back memories. How nice you provide this music for free. Thank you!,1
As a veteran I am greatly appreciative of the recognition this company extends to us on this solemn day.  Thank you very much,1
"I LOVE this song--however, this version I don't believe is the original recording.  Sounds a bit different.  But I still LOVE it.",1
"This is a song that brings in many good memories, Thanks Amazon... Good download and good playing for me and friends",1
"This reminds me of going to the Sign Board Bar at Crown Center in Kansas City...Perfect for an intimate listening crowd.  I can remember people calling out, ""Oh Yeah, play it, Brother!!:",1
"I don't know if this was recorded live or not but the sound came through as if there was no mic, song would have sounded better if you could understand the singer clearly.",1
"""Sadie"" by Son Seals -- This classic Hound Dog Taylor Chicago blues song finds pulse and life in Son Seals. The singer, it seems, has made excuses for things he cannot defend. Sadie has left, and he wants her to return, but she is not sure this is a good idea.  Great piano and B. B. King-like guitar.  ""Sadie, will you come back home tonight Oh Sadie, will you come back home tonight I love you, and you know I'm gonna treat you right.""  I fully recommend ""Sadie"" by Son Seals.  Anthony Trendl [...]",1
"Nancy And Lee is a fine album that pointed Nancy Sinatra firmly toward pop music in the 1960's. This album moved her beyond the rock and roll sex kitten years of Boots, and partnered her with Lee Hazelwood. Particular favorite duets are Summer Wine, Jackson, Some Velvet Morning, Sand, and Lady Bird. Nancy Sinatra fans will love this CD.",1
"Nancy and Lee are a perfect combination,like Sonny and Cher. Lee is the writer with the gravel voice and the troubadour personna. Nancy is  the kitten with the school girl toughness,feminine and smart. They had several hits in their  groovy day and the best are here. Jackson,Summer wine,and Sand are great examples of the duos country pop that defined their unique sound. Billy Strange production brings out the most honest pop sound that is fresh as it was then .This is one of my favorite lps! This is the best of their sixties output,and they also did a swan song album a few years back. But,the charm is in these recordings here. The cd is out of print and sells for a small bundle,but here it is on mp3!",1
So that's why I purchased it and I'm truly not sorry. You will be sorry if you miss this deal-a great collection of songs from an era now bygone by two artist who for a moment helped define that era! A must own for Nancy fans.,1
I have always liked this music and now I can listen to it all I want to and just have fun,1
"I was looking for the actual version of this song that was used in the movie, HOP.  I have nothing against this version...it's just not that version.  If it was, the rating would be higher.",1
I purchased this for my boyfriend.  He has been trying to find this song for years.  Only Amazon has this song.  I downloaded it for the MP3 player.  This is one of his favorite songs.  I highly recommend Amazon for any music.,1
Quirky and timeless retro acid-like alternative-style rocker with kitchy lyrics.  Recommend to anyone exploring or re-exploring the alternative music movement.,1
"I worked with a woman back in the 80s who would sing the hook for this over and over. And I worked PT at a Top 40 radio station at the time, so- you know- I didn't hear it ENOUGH. I hated this song. Now that I'm older (and far removed from from hearing it incessantly), it's a good listen.",1
"Very funny song.  I first heard it when i was in college, and my roommate and i would bust out laughing every time we heard it.  This version seems longer than i remember it, but it's still fun.",1
Nice to have my childhood song available as a crisp digital version. Sure beats a scratchy records or wore out cassette tape sound.,1
THIS IS GOOD STUFF THIS GUY FRANKIE AVALON IS A NEIGBOR OF MINE.FROM PHILA.PA. SAME SCHOOL.HONESTLY BUY THE SONG OR ALBUM YOU WILL LIKE IT IF YOU ARE FROM THE  50SAND 60 S  TONY SO. PHILA.PA.,1
"The old hit singles on vinyl. I purchased this song. The two crushes I had when I was real young was Frankie Avalon and Bobby Sherman. I still like the music,maybe I still blush at my first impressions of love.",1
"From my exposure of VH1, I was in 7th grade when I first heard I Ran by A Flock of Seagulls. This catchy song has a hybrid of synth-pop and electro rock in the beat and appears to be a song about falling in love with someone who is different in some way from many people. Im glad that this song is available to hear online (Amazon prime, youtube, Pandora, iheartradio etc.) because it is rarely played on local radio where my husband and I current reside.",1
A flock of Seagulls had a hit with this song as the music had a rousing beat and the voices that went so well with the beat of the song that took you along for the ride upon the rhythm of the band as they put their heart into the tune they sang and played. Years have come and gone but the songs of The Flock Of Seagulls lives on beautifully.,1
"Being an MTV generation baby, this is a fave. Reminds me of the airline clerk at the airport in The Wedding Singer when Adam Sandler runs off the Vegas to stop Drew Barrymore from eloping... Song popped into my head one day and I had to download it.",1
I originally started working out to this song in the 80's on an Armed Forces Workout ALBUM  so  the  download was a trip down memory lane,1
I added this to my workout mix simply because of its nostalgic value.  It takes me back to the 80's and I can just go with it.  Excellent song; excellent memories!,1
"I know, not exactly the same, but still great.  Others gave bad review but I don't think it warrants that.",1
"download arrived in good shape, although out of all the downloads many of them do not play all the way to end.",1
I love the message of this song. The lyrics are what really got my attention. They are actually really beautiful.,1
"I walk the line, is another fine song by Johnny cash and I remember dining it out along with him as it came out over the Radio. I love his music, the country singer to me that is classic and yet the songs are ageless..to me they are as young as they were when they first came out..",1
"An original that has been covered so many times, This is a song where having the original is an absolute must. A real classic with a great beat and tune",1
Quite possibly the best new wave song ever made. Gary Numan has always been a sound innovator and continues to make amazing music to this day.,1
Husband goes all grinny whenever this is played. Had to get it for him:),1
"I added this one to my mp3 collection. Pretty well known 80's song,catchy beat and lyrics makes for a great dance and driving song.",1
This song was really hard to find.  But there have been several hard to find songs that I've managed to acquire on Amazon.,1
I heard the song on a TV commercial and thought it was one of the songs from the group Cars. But now I have learned to like a new singer. Gary has a lot of interesting songs. I hope to purchase more of his music.,1
"gary newman ain't the style of music I listen to, but this song reminds me of younger days!!!! thanks again!!!!",1
"To me, Gary Numan is still very cutting edge even though this song was recorded many years ago.  His musicality with the keyboards is quite striking and I can never hear enough of this song.",1
I needed the songs from this album to resurrect a compilation album fro the 80's.. called rock 80. An album put out by K-Tel records.,1
In the short science fiction story Transit of Mars the great science fiction writer Arthur C. Clark has his protagonist call this the most awesome piece of music ever composed.  Who am I to argue with a great man?,1
"How does a mere musical mortal like me presume to rate J.S. Bach?  This is the fugue everyone recognizes, and this quality recording can be carried on the Kindle Fire to be played anytime, anywhere.  Carry a piece of musical history with you today.",1
This is a great song for the the adult type and make one laugyh and laugh. Everyone I let hear eat just laughed amd ;loved it. Get it and pass it down tn ones family. Thanks for such a cool song.,1
ya this was a must have back in the bar fly days im glad that i remembered to add it to my collection,1
"lol, I love this song. I laugh so hard every time I hear it, and then I play it again.",1
"So funny with great lyrics and yes, the picking rocks too ! Great party song, and one for the road also !",1
"If You Like Collecting Odd Songs That Have A Comedy Overtone, This Is The Song For You. Although It Contains Adult Language, It Is Quite Unique And Is A Great Addition To Your Collection",1
"It's funny and a VERY vulgar commentary on person-to-person interactions.  DO NOT DOWNLOAD unless one is comfortable hearing a stream of expletives.  You don't want to hear from behind you, ""Honey, what are you listening to?!""  Ooops.",1
"It was a musical cattle prod when it first came out, but it just tame now.  Fun to re-visit, but it didn't stay long in my collection.",1
"If you are in to classics, this is a great tune to listen to.  The orchestration in this is great and the composer did a great job making this record.",1
"As far as famous instrumentals go, this is one of my favorites, and is well played. Takes you on a journey through your imagination.",1
The introduction to the Lone Ranger with the William Tell Overture behind it works perfert on my Ipod.  It brings back great memories.,1
A wonderful piece of music that is inspiring positive actions within the listener. Such music should be heard daily by everyone.,1
"If you're an old ""hard""rock and roller like myself, you'll love this one.  Most young people would not be able to guess how old this song is from listening to it.  It's still awesome music.",1
This is a classic tune that has been remastered for the Mp3 download. It put Uriah Heep in mainstream rock on the radio. I was in highschool when this came out and it moves me still.,1
"I bought the song for a dvd I was making of my parents.  Such a beautiful, touching song.  There's not a dry eye in the house when Nat sings.",1
for those of us who dream of romantic love songs this one is it...,1
"I have always loved Stardust by Hoagy Carmichael, and he is an IU alum, like I am. Years ago Nat King Cole was one of my favorite singers. I would wait up all night to hear some of his songs on the radio. Now I can listen to the best",1
Perhaps a little maudlin but I would nominate this song and singer as the best planet Earth could produce in any intergalactic faceoff. There is nobody or no thing smoother than King Cole.,1
"Of course, Nat King Cole is the King. Some thought it was Elvis, but the real king was Nat. Stardust was his best in my opinion, although he had so many best ones some would argue and be justified.",1
I wasn't a Tina Turner fan until I was much older.  I also wasn't fond of this song until maturity changed my musical tastes.  This song is so good!,1
Chris Tomlin has become a mainstay in Christian praise songs.  This is another of his finer hymns and I look forward to more.,1
this album is a wonderful one. Chris Tomlin is an outstanding performer and writer and this cd shows it all over again,1
"Great song! All of the double meanings in it, the synth. The sound quality is great, very clear. Totally 80s and totally awesome.",1
Would have been great to play at Chemistry class in high school. I heard this on the radio of a coworker and it was so catchy I decided to buy it!,1
"Classic 80's tune. If you are a fan of the 80's new wave music, this is a must.",1
And after tagging it proceeded to download it. Classic tune and a fine addition to any playlist. Not sure about the rest of the songs on the CD as I did not listen to them.,1
"This is awesome, I like way this was done and I would recommend this album to anyone that is interested in this type of music,",1
What a song! This is and always has been a song you never scan past...it just grabs you.....crank that volume and enjoy! Just a great tune for anyone's playlist of great songs.,1
"In my opinion this was one of the BIGGEST songs of the 1980s, needless-to-say that was my reason for purchasing the MP3 version of this song!!!.  I would recommend this song to anyone who is looking for Classic Rock Music from the 1980s!!!.",1
"Not much to say...excellent recording of a classic song. Cant go to trivia night anywhere without the entire place yelling ""Science!!""in unison if the word is mentioned. That to me makes a classic song.",1
She blinded me! The song was also used in the 80's movie Weird Science. I think Oingo Boingo also had music in this movie.,1
"This song is so unbelievably awesome. I found it with the SHAZAM app, it named the song, gave me the lyrics, then allowed me the option to purchace through Amazon.",1
"Definitely, this song by Thomas Dolby, is one of the most listenable and clever songs in the last 35 years, because of the sound and lyrics!",1
I downloaded this song for my Mom's funeral. It is one of my favorite songs.,1
"As music goes, the download was smooth, the quality of the file was flawless to the novice ears, and when played on multiple devices, to include an mp3 disc where I had over 200 songs made no differencethe quality was spot on.  Amazon has delivered yet another fine product and I love the fact that the songs I have purchased are backed up on their cloud.  What a great service, I love it, and I enjoy the massive selection offered by Amazon!  I love the ease in which music can be selected, listened to, and backed up via Amazon's digital services.",1
I sing this song always every time I hear it  at the end I choke up with tears in my eyes this song gets me,1
"My favorite hymn with a bit of new.  Still love the origional, but this also makes my heart smile. A real Blessing",1
"This is a beautiful rendition of the classic hymn Amazing Grace. Anyone who hears it will be blessed, I'm sure.",1
"I would normally say ""don't mess with such a wonderful classic""; however, this rendition is so well done that to me it is an instant classic itself. I could listen to it and the original over and over again - they are just so beautifully done.",1
"I knew what it was when I went looking for it. Clear digital recording, the price was worth it. Another keeper, excellent value.",1
Love chris Tomlinson. His music says just what I am thinking,1
"Love CHRISTian music! It can make your soul dance with joy, cry with joy & sadness, & anything in between. CHRISTian music is an awesome way to communicate with our Father God Almighty. Wish the whole world could only hear CHRISTian music that caused their dark souls to enter into His Light of Love, Forgiveness, Acceptance, Grace, Mercy, etc.",1
Love the arrangement on this hym. Chris Tomlin has an amazing voice.,1
This short praise song fits in so well with this classic hymn.it is is beautiful and moving arrangement. I love it.,1
"I LOVE the entire album but had to at least get this song, it is my favorite an yes I do sing with it in the car (poor other drivers and passengers) lol ...it touches my soul in great way!",1
"Amazing Grace (My Chains Are Gone) by Chris Tomlinson is truly amazing. Version of song as it was written, but left this line out for many years.",1
"This song is the greatest version I have ever heard.  Very uplifting and brings the message across,  I love to sing along.",1
"Glad to have access to this music.  Really like Chris Tomlin's music.  Keep his music coming, and I'll keep buying it.",1
Not to be morbid....my grown children hate to talk about my death...however I want this song by Chris played at my funeral. Don't cry for me. I will be in the arms of my Saviour.,1
"I have listened tot he song, sung the song and also enjoyed so much about it.  Because when Jesus took my chains away - I was free.  You can be as well.  Listen to the song and surrender your will to the Lord Jesus.  He can and will set you free from Sin.",1
"There are many artists who've done Amazing Grace however, some are not so pleasant to listen to, some are hard to listen to but not this one!",1
"I love this song.  Was glad to be able to find it and get it downloaded.  It was my first attempt at downloading a song.  I admit to not being computer saavy, but this was very hard for me to do.  Because of that I will not download again.  I was however able to talk with a Jenny at Amazon who guided me through the steps and was very pleasant during my time on the phone with her.  If I could have I would have hugged her.  I would recommend this song to anyone who likes the old hymns and praise and worship.  A great mixture of both.",1
Really like cris Tomlin singing. I really like the words to most of his songs. I brought because I just like his singing,1
"I love this song, my family views it as a memorial to my father who passed away in December 2011.",1
This song is a great blend of a classic hymn with a new flavor. I love this song and find it very worshipful. You won't regret buying this song.,1
"For the price, this is a great song. Good sound, good message, talented artist. How can you go wrong with this?",1
This version is a great song. I was so glad to find it here.. He is a great singer... I love Praise and Worship music.. So this hits the spot..,1
"This song is a little bit updated version of an old standard and favorite hymn.  I would highly recommend it to any Christian music fan, to anyone who likes contemporary music, any Chris Tomlin fan, or just anyone who likes the song Amazing Grace.  There's enough of the standard/familiar hymn to satisfy the older more traditional crowd while still appealing to the younger more contemporary crowd as well.",1
"Love this song!  When ever I heard it on the radio, I always thought I should buy it.  Finally did - and love it!",1
You can never go wrong with a Chris Tomlin song. You can tell how much he loves the Lord and shares his faith.,1
I have loved this song for a long time and had no idea that it was Chris Tomlin.  Great singer/songwriter,1
"This is a beautiful CD and it glorifies God. His love is amazing, His grace is limitless and He sets us free!!!",1
A song that is about God's Grace and how our chains of sin can be removed by His grace. Grace a Gift that gets you eternity in heaven.,1
"It is a really good quality song and It is comforting, soothing and inspirational.  Good for the heart and soul.",1
wonderful song with a new element...who doesn't know Amazing Grace...but who really knows His amazing grace....He is so Good Amen,1
"This has a country style of the classic song, with a new, well planned twist.  My kids love it. :)",1
I love this song. I purchased another artist's version of this song and it was too lengthy. This version by Chris Tomlinson captures the true essence of the song.,1
This song is great! Songs like these allow you to worship our Lord the way He should be worshipped.  Thank you.,1
I really like this version of Amazing Grace.  God can set us free.  What a relief when our chains are gone.,1
"Very easy download, that I added it to my galaxy s3, macpro book, and dell laptop.  Now that I purchased a bluetooth with audio, I  listen more to my music through my s3. Again fantastic sound from the cloud. I use the amazon cloud app on the s3.",1
"Chris  Tomlin, must immerse himself in the word of GOD, as  every song, is a reflection of scripture & fills my cup, ALWAYS!",1
I love this song so much that my daughter wanted to learn it and now this is one of the songs she sings solo at our church on a regular basis.,1
It is a message of hope and direction. It fills you with Gods presence and peace. I listen to this over and over.,1
This song is so beautiful and I was excited to be able to purchase it.  It is a great addition to my music collection.,1
"This song makes me cry they way it's handled here because it is so touching.  Great song render so well by Christ Tomlin, check out other songs by Chris Tomlin.",1
"I have hear this song sang by different people, but chris tomlin does it best. Chris Tomlin is my favorite christan singer, hes got a great voice.",1
"This version of Amazing Grace is beautiful, it mixes two songs together that sounds so good together.  In my mind I would have never mixed a song with Amazing Grace but this song mixed with My chains are gone gives me the chills and I love to sing it in church.",1
"Of all the religious songs, this is probably the most known.  There are probably over a hundred renditions available, but this one I really like.  This is one of those songs that you can search the Internet and find a ""free"" copy, but I wanted a version that the artist got rewarded for his/her work.  I hope this makes sense.",1
"Chris Tomlin seems to sing this song from a place of faith rather than as a popular folk song that the singer doesn't really believe.  And, this version ties together Jesus' amazing grace and what it means to me personally - He set me free!",1
"let's if you really read these post, this is a great song, Steve Wariner needs to record a verison for Grandpa, this was the second one I downloaded and paid for, the frist one I downloaded was bad, had to delete it, it was a bad, part of the song was missing.",1
"loved [holes in the floor of heaven ] very special song for me ,downloaded all just my favorites for special listening ,great deal for downloads.",1
we downloaded this to add to our long playlist of music on the go to keep us entertained when the moment called for it :),1
"This is a really good song, however, if I had been able to listen to the full song I would not have bought it.  It was not what I was looking for.  Steve Wariner is very good, just wasn't the words I was looking for.",1
True country. A great example of country music from the 90's.,1
Purchased many songs and they always download without any problems. Amazon makes it so easy and I have the music I need in no time.,1
This song was played at my brother and sister in laws funeral and it was so touching that I wanted to get a copy of it and keep forever.  Very pleased with this selection.,1
"I love this song, I was looking for the Blake Sheldon version, but this worked just as well. Great song!",1
We got this song to use in a DVD Memorial for my son's father who passed away from cancer.  My son picked it put.,1
"The words, the music, the artist all make this song so beautiful.  I recommend this song to anyone missing their loved ones.",1
"Back in the 80's, there were so many great songs, that some got lost in the shuffle, only for those 80's kids to bring them back in their current work. This underrated song was all but lost to the radio time vaults till Napoleon Dynamite made it its credits song, perfectly going along with the movie. The result was the rediscovering of this classic, and amazingly, it still held up. Covers quickly ensued.  Musically, the song has a lite poppy feel, that is distinctively 80's. Is it 70's? No. Is it 90's? Nope, it is unmistakably 80's. It's a nice feel to the song, and it really adds an extra flavor to it. Vocally, while the verses lag, and fail to deliver a great punch, making for the only complaint of the song, the main chorus is perfect. Well, almost, that ""I promise you,"" does drag it down.  However, the lyrics are really the crown jewel and highlight of the song. They're as great now as they were then, if not more so. They're well written, emotional in unexpected ways, and it really speaks about the aspect of love that's rarely touched upon: Us guys who can't think of the perfect words to say to our perfect and lovely ladies. The lyrics really hit home for us poor guys, and really make it an even better song than it already was.  Overall, one of the most underrated and forgotten about songs from the 80's that was lost for so many years, but is finally making a comeback. Why iTunes doesn't have it is beyond me, and is really a musical travesty. So many fans are getting jibbed of great music.  In other arenas, the song went perfect with Napoleon Dynamite, and the song seemed better because of it. It's like they completed each other to make one another more emotional in their own little way.  And because of the movie, covers ensued. Anberlin's cover of the song wasn't that great. It was a straight up cover, with some acoustic elements added to it, that really didn't add to the song. Plus, they are so alike on vocals, you still had the same problem. New Found Glory also covered the song, but they made it more upbeat than the original, giving it more of a pop/rock influence, but it still kept the emotion of the original song, and added another layer to it.",1
The Promise by When In Rome Appears to be a cheery song about the singer reassuring someone that they care about that they are always going to be there for that person.  The combo of synth-pop and 80s dance also make The Promise a good song to add to a happy love song playlist.,1
"It's sad that in 2015 music in general is broken and fake There are those that love to point fingers and pick on the 80's and the music that came from that decade of excess! The interesting thing that decade did have some dated corny music but, even some of the over-blown 1 hit wonders had great 1 hits  Case in point When In Rome  with there massive hit The Promise I find it hard to believe that a band that craft such a flawless single only had one hit But, it's a great timeless one hit! Even though it sounds very 1980's with the key board nobody is using auto-tune to hide anything It's not overly studio produced there is life in this song (it has a soul) The Promise is a true 80's classic in every sense of the word anyone who'll disagree it and say it sucks, is lying to them self It's a catchy perfect pop song  10/10",1
"I discovered this song from Napoleon Dynamite too, and loved it instantly. What a classic, and what amazing genius in it.",1
"I do not listen to this music a buy these as gifts for friends, never listen to the music I buy",1
just now downloaded it but have been listening to it on radio for months. It is very great song one that gets you pumped and moving to praise the Lord.,1
How can we keep from praising our marvelous God?  This song is timeless and helped me to stay positive through major surgery.  Chris Tomlin is so versatile and his music is great.,1
Love Chris Tomlin.  He sure has his finger on MY pulse when it comes to WONDERFUL Christian lyrics!,1
"This is a very nice song...  the music,  the harmonized vocals,  and the song's meaning make me think of this as a masterpiece,  of sorts.",1
I love the guitar and the words of this song.  I heard Gerd Vogel of the Sunnyland Blues Band play this live in the 90's at a blues show.  He was great on the guitar.  Sounded just like Gary Moore's version.,1
I really was intrigued by this song when I heard it on Scrubs. I think it has holding power.,1
"""The Promise""  can be a perfect theme song for the male protagonist in the movie ""Knocked Up"" , or maybe for the sequel , if the actors can agree to it , but adding the cast of the movie ""This Is The End"" .",1
Crazy about this song in the 80s and heard it on radio and remembered how much I used to love it.  Purchased it right away.,1
Love this song from When in Rome. It stands the test of time from 80's to present. I wanted to add this to my MP3 library,1
"I always liked the 80's musik mainly I just buy the singles or one or 2 songs from a album,",1
"All the classic Elements that come together to create a Timeless 80's Vibe. An upbeat driving musical tone, while the lyrics have, both a slight melancholy as well as a hint of hope.",1
Brings back all the great memories of my youth and the music never disappoints.  Highly recommend just to relive those moments.,1
"And, I love being able to purchase all these songs. It reminds me of the old days when we paid 30-cents for a single-45 record. You only bought the songs you liked, *vbs*.",1
Brings me back to my youth in 1985!  I never knew it sounded so punchy and strong.  I always heard it on the radio so this is a revalationt to me.  Add it to your Turner collection!,1
I ALWAYS  LOVE  JANET  I HOPE  SHE'S  MAKING  MORE  MUSIC  OR HOUSE  MUSIC.  SHE'S  THE BOMB.,1
"A Janet Classic! This is smooth, sultry, and flirtatious set in a beat that you can groove to.",1
"The heavy bass, and smooth Voice of Janet Jackson really intertwine to create a song that makes you want to move.",1
"I loved this song that's why I purchased it! I will definitely purchase more songs very very soon, that's a promise!!!",1
"That's right; Ms. Jackson samples from the God Father of Soul in the wonderfully made mix. She remember her soulful roots well in this tune showing us love in her cool quite way. If you don't have this song inside your mp3 player then you ain't no player for long;"" That's the way love goes"".",1
"My girl, my mentor, the 1 I wanna be lk when I grow up! Next to Janet there is no other like her!",1
"Hearing song for the first time, was like having a car fall on me. I've since fallen in love with it.",1
"This is one of those songs that fits the high-spirited, high-energy woman who comes into your life and gets lost in a blizzard, needs you to be her stable running mate. Michael Murphey had other hit songs but this one still stands up because it describes that wild pony who has heart and spirit that you find irresisitable",1
"This song belongs to my past present & future. The lyrics are amazingly soulful & sad & promising in a spiritual way. The lyrics are powerful & the music written to go with them is a perfect blend. ""Wildfire"" is one of my favorite songs of all time. It holds deep meaning. jkm",1
Great song! One of the landmarks of the seventies culture and still very much alive today. Beautiful images and poetry.,1
The guitar reminds me of wild grass and sunlight. A woman and her horse become lost in the wilderness-and then one day return...,1
Another one of those songs that I can get lost in; the smooth melody always takes me to another place.,1
"As you get older, sometimes you like to reflect on your lost youth.  I remember listening to this record when I was in college and feeling sad and melancholy sometimes.  Listening to it now brings back a lot of memories good and bad.  It reminds me that I was young once.",1
Many years ago I saw her in person; she's has a good voice.,1
Any woman who may feel intimidated or lacks self confidence should make this song their mantra.  It should build your confidence and make you feel good.  It's a great song.,1
Classic representation of the Women's Movement in Music.  Lyrics and sound are awesome.  Just love it so much!!!!! Thank you.,1
Another great old song from long ago that is on my Sansa fuze to enjoy daily at work. The old songs when music was great.,1
I love this Helen Reddy song. Very easy to order and download. This version is the best and I would recommend it.,1
How can you not love this wonderful song by Juice Newton. I used to listen to this song when I was a young kid.,1
One of my very favorite songs form the 1980s and now a great song for me to run to. I love it! Juice newton has a great voice and the beat keeps me going.,1
"This was my favorite song by Janet I watched te movie  Poetic justice  I liked her look in that film and I liked her sound to .This song gets 2 thumbs up from me  its so romantic  ,yet sad .",1
"There is no question that today, music has honestly lost one of its brightest singers, Joe Cocker who passed away at 70 years old. He honestly was one of the greatest singers of all time, who knew how to belt out remarkable songs on his own, and doing renditions of other artists songs. He had his ups and downs with his life, but always kept music in tune. When he did another artist in song, he took it into another place like his cover of the classic Ray Charles song Un-Chain My Heart, which came out in the 1987. The song just remains a classic, and showcases his bluesy voice and a soulful heart kept alive in song and in real heart. It is truly a blessing at soul, and what he put out with great music. Joe Cocker will definitely be missed in song, and in spirit. His heart has been un-chained.  Joe Cocker 1944-2014  Song: A",1
Very soulful music came with alot of Cocker's music. Absolutely love his sound and the way he sings his music,1
"I love his rendition of this song so much, I bought the CD to hear  the rest of the songs",1
This is a great song. I am glad that I bought it. When you hear a great song then you are able to bougth it that makes it more enjoyable to have. Love it.,1
Country music at it's finest from the 1980's era.  Tend to like this type of music better than what is being played from the 1990's to 2000's.,1
Always loved this song and reggae music.  Maxi Priest is a favorite of mine.,1
"Excellent. This is Maxi at his best. Great vocals, great beat - Great to listen to,",1
The only thing about this song that really strikes me as amazing... would have to be the chorus to the song. Otherwise... eh.,1
"Awesome!! If you enjoy earthy rich music with an awesome head-bopping bass line, you'll love this.",1
How can You not like this song? Classic and an earworm...PLus Deadpool helped a new generation find a great old song.,1
The people who bought this song must've had poopy inside their ears. This song epitomizes early 80's FM cheese. Don't buy it! it'll make yer ears bleed. it's so bad they don't even play it in elevators anymore!,1
One of Juice Newton's more popular songs. It is just as good as it was when it was first released.,1
This song takes me back to my listening youth. She is great at taking people home to a better time then nowadays. Very happy with all the transaction.,1
"I use this as my alarm tone for my phone, why not start out by being an angel in the Morning",1
for when you are feeling down this one might help you up again! lovely song,1
"What a positive and uplifting song!  I love Nat King Cole, he's the greatest!  This song makes me smile.  It is well worth the cost.  See more at vyctoryab dot wix dot com slash xplr.",1
"Smile though your heart is aching Smile even though it's breaking When there are clouds in the sky You'll get by If you Smile through your pain and sorrow Smile and maybe tomorrow You'll see the sun come shining through For you  Light up your face with gladness Hide every trace of sadness Although a tear may be ever so near That's the time (that's the time) you must keep on trying Smile- What's the use of crying You'll find that life is still worthwhile If you just smile.  That's the time (that's the time) you must keep on trying, Smile- What's the use of crying You'll find that life is still worthwhile If you just smile.  Smile though your heart is aching Smile Even though it's breaking When there are clouds in the sky- You'll get by  That's the time (that's the time) you must keep on trying Smile- What's the use of crying You'll find that life is still worthwhile If you just You'll find that life is still worthwhile If you just smile.  Smile, a very special piece composed by the great Charlie Chaplin for his 1936 film entitled ""Modern Times,"" had its lyrics and title added by John Turner and Geoffrey Parsons in 1954. This song, a classic little masterpiece, gets the royal treatment from Nat ""King"" Cole, who delivers this ballad with panache. Nat's excellent diction, sophisticated phrasing and sense of timing make this version of ""Smile"" one of my very favorites. It never fails to move me; this is an incredibly poignant musical number. I highly recommend this music.",1
"I hear the airplane sound and the tempo of drums, organ, bass, guitar, piano, trumpet, and flute played and classy",1
This song brings back awesome memories! I remember grooving to this song at the local skating rink moving my hips to the unique beat of her first hit!,1
"Great music and well worth the time, energy and the expense in both obtaining and listening to this music.  I highly recommend this!",1
she us too lid Lakers girls  and jump to singer back in the 80's she is super rock Paula steel around bicouse she is good very good an amazon always have the best,1
This is Paula Abdul at her best!! Remember dancing to this song all night and still love listening to it.,1
OKAY its Nat King Cole singing Unforgettable so what else needs to be said. Love the fact that its remastered-means a crisp and clean listen.,1
"Another gr8 hit by Dierks!  It's been around for awhile, but still love it.  Upbeat....gets me up & moving! Hope his hits keep coming.",1
"A classic from the movie 9 1/2 Weeks. Joe Cocker is a classic too, with a truly original style. We'll never forget him...",1
"how can you not love this one? it's so beautiful, if you want to tell someone how much you love them, this is the song...",1
It just doesn't get much better than this music especially this track.  Great addition to your music favorite music collection.,1
"There is no song, past or present, that is not SUPER when it was done by Nat!!!  I highly recommend this one!!",1
Takes me back to the 60s/70s instantly. There atr some great songs by Joe I've never heard. Didn't realize he was so versatile.,1
A solid R&B tune and a good performance by Joe as always. It's always a pleasure to hear his soulful voice.,1
"If you like Joe Cocker, this is a great one for your library. This is old school!!! A good one to add to your library.",1
At the age of 66 and widowed I have been going with this woman who I like very much.  I decided to make her a music CD of songs that I though would express my love for her.  This was one of those songs.  In all there was 11 songs that I picked out. I will have to tell you is was some work to find the exactly right song that said the right thing but in the end it was more then worth it.  After I made the CD our relationship moved to a new level maybe two or three nrw levels.  So if you want to impress that one you love send him or her a CD of your chosing that expresses your love for her.,1
"Okay, when it comes to music, I'm from a past generation (or two). I'd never heard of Michael Martin Murphy ... even if he did hang out with Willie Nelson. I liked his voice - mostly a smooth high-end baritone - so much that I downloaded six more songs. He's great to listen to whether country-western or crossover songs. A little higher baritone than Dean Martin, and more like Gene Autry.",1
"This fun 1982 hit by ""Bad to the Bone"" by George Thorogood and the Destroyers needs volume. I work out to it, keeping it a regular running playlist song.  I'm a car singer. When it is just me, I turn it up and sing at the top of my lungs. This one brings out my inner blues man. As a running song, it carries a strong tempo, a hard beat, and twice the attitude found in anything Katy Perry sings.  ""On the day I was born, the nurses all gathered 'round. And they gazed in wide wonder, at the joy they had found. The head nurse spoke up, and she said leave this one alone. She could tell right away, that I was bad to the bone. Bad to the bone Bad to the bone B-B-B-B-Bad to the bone B-B-B-B-Bad B-B-B-B-Bad Bad to the bone.""  I fully recommend ""Bad to the Bone"" by George Thorogood and the Destroyers.  Anthony Trendl [...]",1
Exactly what I was expecting it to be. I am happy with my purchase.,1
Being the only daughter of a single mother this has been a favorite of mine.,1
I think this songs speaks to all single mothers with sons. It is sweet and encouraging for everyone on one day or another.,1
"Being over 60, I remember so many of these musical groups and I enjoy adding them to my IPod. Great song",1
"Appears in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Christine-VHS/dp/6302516919/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Christine [VHS</a>] and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Terminator-2-VHS/dp/B00000JGEI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Terminator 2 [VHS</a>] and fits so well both times.",1
I'm probably not bad to the bone but this serves as the soundtrack for those times when I'd like to be...,1
"If you ever saw them you already know, so there's no need for me to write anything else.  (And if you didn't get the chance to see them live, then download it anyway.)  It's GREAT!",1
This is my favorite George Thorogood song.  If you've never listened to it you may want to do so before purchasing it.,1
I chose this rating because I had no problems. I would refer this anybody I know who mainly listen to classic rock!,1
"George Thorogood plays no frills rock & roll heavily steeped in Bo Diddley and Chuck Berry.  ""Bad To The Bone"" is probably his most recognizable song and is a chunky piece of braggadocio that echoes the great Mr. Diddley.  Mr. Thorogood gravelly voice rumbles through the song alongside his buzz saw guitar with a horn piercing in and out to add an exclamation point.",1
"This song reminds me of muscle cars and Jack Daniels with its macho swagger.  It was used to marvelous effect in the movie ""Moroccan Gigolos.""",1
"Will definitely down ALL of my favorite music instead of buying the album, CD etc.  Very easy to download with click of a couple of buttons.",1
This product is as advertised. Satisfactorily made and serves the purpose for which it was designed. Would recommend it to others.,1
"Bought this for a family video...exactly what I wanted. I was a great, crystal clear recording of the original song.",1
"This has been a favorite for a long time, I've just always been too cheap to download it, thanks to my boss for the gift certificate!",1
I love this song sung by Dierks Bentley. He brings it across so very good. He has a wonderful voice,1
This song is so amazing. It is so smooth and sexy. It is a song any woman would be okay with hearing.,1
I like this song but was thinking of the song my eyes when I purchased it.,1
i wish he was still making the same type of music as this  its still one of my favorit songs,1
"I love this song ""come a little closer""... Dierks Bentley has a really nice soft, relaxing, country sound to his voice.. He has a few other songs out that I actually like to.",1
"this song was an awesome song, I just love Dierks music,  thank you amazon for making it possible to download without no waiting!",1
"It's Dierks Bentley, enough said. Any music this man releases is great. If you're not a country music fan you will be by just listening to Dierks Bentley.",1
This song is so pretty. I searched for years to find this song because I did not know the name of it but finally I found it and I'm very happy that I did. It's just so beautiful.,1
"Really the movie?! If you did not see it, you might not get it.........",1
"There is honestly so much that could be said about Joe Cocker and his gifts in song. The guy was honestly one of the most amazing singers that had ever came out of the Woodstock. He honestly was amazing with each and every song he had recorded and performed live. The guy was absolutely a remarkable singer But this past year had showed a sad and tragic end to his brilliant end, losing his life to lung cancer, as a result from his twenty years plus of drug and alcohol addiction. But he left behind a cavalcade of great songs from With A Little Help From My Friends, and especially Up Where We Belong. His collaboration with Jennifer Warnes which won a academy award for Best Song and a Grammy Award in 1983. It is a lovely romantic ballad that still captures the soul of the heart. Joe & Jennifer had a connection that many of today's artists couldn't even come close to at heart. If you had never even heard of a Joe Cocker song before, than this is one I would recommend going to.  Song: A-",1
"It is a great song performed by the writer, Buffy St. Marie, and it is teriffic by Warnes and Crocker.",1
A great duet and a song that was perfect for the movie. Joe Cocker had a sound all his own you never confused his voice with someone else.,1
Beautiful song and beautiful voice.  All I can say is LOVE.,1
Was the song in An Officer and A Gentlemen.  One of my favorite movies.,1
A lovely song that is timeless. Joe Cocker's voice was different and unmatched.,1
"His whiskey voice, her higher than high voice, love song extra special leads to this being one heck of a great make out song.  Had to watch An Officer and A Gentleman again after hearing it.",1
"I have loved this song for MANY years, and if you are going through music therapy for cancer or a life issue that is testing your strength, what the words say will lift you up. It's not a religious thing, it's a spirit lifting song, anyone can relate to.",1
"LOVE THIS SONG... FEELING LIKE YOU CANT GO ON, WELL LISTEN TO THIS SONG, YES LIFE GOES ON.. THE SUN WILL SHINE.. Smoochiesss...",1
This is another song that brings back memories from my teenage years.  I love listening to all the different artist sing.,1
"I came across this song on YouTube and I remember when it first came out. I also remember Adam Curry on MTV asking, `Why is Dan Aykroyd in the video?'  Check it out if you don't believe me.  I got the song because it reminds me of simpler times and our first mass outreach to help others before corporations and governments made everything go them.  It's a great song and it was good to see some of the performers again.",1
"Songs like ""Let the Music Play"" never go out of style.  Some of my relatives who weren't born when this song was made enjoy just it as much as their ""elders""!",1
This song reached #1 on US Danmce Chart in 1983 and #8 on US Singles Chart in 1984.  It's been covered by several artists and groups over the years.,1
"I downloaded this mp3 song and added it to my ""Walking Playlist"". Shannon's music brought back memories of listening to the SOS band, Expose' and other back in the day artists. I love listening to this genre of music because of it's up beat tempo.",1
Not one of my favorites but it creates a certain mood.  Purchased the remastered version.  It was not as good as the original.  Like the tempo of this song.,1
"This version isn't bad, but its not exactly the great version we heard on the radio.  It was a great record, and Shannon had a great voice.",1
This will forever be one of my favorite songs!! Such a classic dance tune!!,1
great 80's dance song or just to add to your 80's library collection of great songs,1
Here is another song from the 80's era. It is a good song to listen  and to dance to. Shannon is a good singer. If you don't remember this particular song you can play a small portion of it on Amazon's MP3 store. I would recommend buying it if you like songs from the 80's. Sandra K,1
I have been looking for this song for like 10 years now and finally found it just after my sister died.,1
"GREAT CLASSIC ABOUT BRIAN WILSON OF THE BEACH BOYS DOG DROWNING AT SEA, LOVED THIS SONG FROM THE GET GO",1
"This song came out when I was quite young.  I decided to buy it  for the memories, if not for any other reason.  I would recommend this song to anyone who is looking for Classic Rock Music from the 1970s/1980s!!!.",1
"This song is about a dog who died based on a true incident.  It is SOOOO beautiful!.  Henry Gross has such an amazing voice and it just carries you along in a beautiful melody.  It is a bit sad about the dog, but it will bring you to the ""heart of the matter"" and it is peaceful and beautiful and lovely.  The tune is one you won't forget.",1
"Not my favorite LvB melody, but right up there.  This is a good performance.",1
"I love Beethoven, and this is just so wonderful to listen to when it is so well played like this!",1
There will never be another Beethoven. Moonlight Sonata is the perfect example of a glorious dream put to glorious music. A wonderful mood enhancer.,1
"I am not fond of the performer's interpretation; it is a little ""up-tempo"" for my taste. The Sonata itself is tireless and always good to hear.",1
"EXACTLY WHAT I EXPECTED  This is a great recording. The recording is impeccable. I love these old classics!  I not only like them for easy listening, as well as helping me to gain more appreciation for this kind of music.",1
This performance really captures the haunting beauty of one of Beethoven's most renowned and most popular sonatas. It is exactly what people think of when they hear the title--no extra embellishment.,1
This song is so lovely and it evokes some emotion.  Just now discovering classical but this is a must have.,1
"I love this song. Brings back memories of my past with ladies who will never learn, that what goes around comes around.",1
I like this song very much. It's music is one of a kind. I can and will rate this piece of music a five star. Thank you for allowing me to purchase it on your site.,1
"I am happy with every song I buy for my Kindle, via Amaon.  The quality of the songs are amazing.",1
"great song by a band in their prime, a great representation of 80s atmospheric music. Not necessarily the kind of music I listen to, but a friend turned me on to it.",1
Just one of those songs I love to hear. The song stays i your head. It certainly is alive. Wow.,1
"another good song for that early 1990s play list. this song reminds me of my Navy days, driving the strip looking for chicks with my buddies",1
"For Whatever Reason, So Alive by Love And Rockets came into my awareness again when I unintentionally heard them at a Walgreens store near my apartment when my husband was getting us some things. I had thought about this song out of the blue less than 14 days prior and it is a song that I have rarely heard on local radio where I currently live or online. I remember this rock/pop song fondly because I first heard it via local radio growing up and I enjoyed the message of a mystery person captivating someones attention and making them feel very much on top of the world metaphorically speaking with lyrics such as the feel Im on top again baby thats got everything to do with you.",1
I purchased this MP3 and downloaded the music into my computer and found that the quality of the sound was incredible and the price was within my budget. I gave this song a FIVE STAR rating! Thank Amazon for the great service and ease of the transaction in whole.,1
"until after watching the 200th episode special. The show was my favorite of all time, I can still watch it and laugh, well crafted, well written and perfectly cast. The song had a bittersweet tone to it, reflecting the theme of the show, life may be lonely, it may get you down, but there is always someplace to go where everyone knows you and actually wants you around. Great song. Gary Portnoy also wrote the theme to Punky Brewster, at the time I used to think the song, like Punky (she's grown into a lovely young woman) was cute, and at times it felt a bit cheesy but as I hear it today that song actually makes me miss those cheesy days.",1
I have liked this song ever since it hit the radio waves. It is a nice easy enjoyable song to listen to. It is a song that I like to listen to every chance I get. I like Berite Higgins singing this song. Thank you Sandy McClaflin,1
I have always loved this song!  It is one I grew up with and now my children also enjoy it!,1
Always was a Charley Pride fan.  His rendition of this song is great.  Couldn't have been any happier.  Thank You Amazon,1
i heard this in a movie so i had to download it. Waste of $0.99 imho .i never heard of the singer peaches,1
"This is a great song because it shows God's sovereignty. The example of Lazarus is used to show that even when we think God is too late to intervene, He does things that we think are impossible. This song has been an encouragement to me in many difficult situations.",1
No one sings this song like them. I heard this song on the radio years ago and it still sounds the same today with just as much feeling.,1
I saw them in person in 2013 and their music is so great!  This song always makes me tear up - because it reminds me that things happen not in our time (as humans) but in God's time - and he is never late!,1
Really liked this song by this singer enough to buy the single song.  Really not a lot you can say about a single song except I like it.,1
"I heard this song on the Gaither Gospel Hour and just had to have it.  When Karen Peck sings a song you know she's going to tell you a great story.  What a message, God has perfect timing.  Even when He's four days late He's still on time.  Amen.  You will be cheering by the end of this song.  Karen Peck and New River are an amazing group and you will be blessed by this song.  I would recommend this song to everyone.",1
A great song and pretty fun to dance to. Give it a listen.,1
"I love daft punk, its some of the best music in the electronic area of house there is, if you get a chance check out this stuff, if your into House beats and Disco music mixed with modern day electronics. One word can explain it all, Beautiful!",1
"It is not fast paced like many songs I like, but it has a pleasant tune that I enjoy quite often.",1
"I have loved his music for many years. Ive been loading up my iPad with stuff from my past. Amazon seems to have it, so what can be easier.",1
Sometimes you just wanna take a quick trip back to yester-year. This song is as good as it was the day it released!,1
It's easy to purchase your favorite songs on Amazon. You have the choice of playing them on your Cloud Player or adding them to your MP3 so you can have them with you.,1
This is one of Duran Duran's best songs of all time (along with Hungry Like the Wolf and Rio). Thanks!,1
If you like Duran Duran which my kids loved you will really like ordinary world.,1
"By the early 1990s, Duran Duran's popularity had faded. Their album Liberty had proved a commercial failure, its two singles failing to make a significant showing on British or American charts.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dDLiVwpv89s  It was not until Capitol leaked ""Ordinary World"" to a radio station in Florida in the autumn of 1992 that it looked like Duran Duran mania might yet hit again. The single proved so popular that Capitol had to push the US release date up, ultimately releasing it in December.  The keyboards in the song were arranged and performed by Nick Rhodes and John Jones. The drums were played by Steve Ferrone at Maison Rouge.  The guitar solo that characterizes this song was arranged and performed by Warren Cuccurullo, former player with Frank Zappa. His instrumental rock trio version became a staple of his solo shows and was included on one of his solo albums ""Roadrage"".  The music video was filmed by director Nick Egan at Huntington Gardens in San Marino, California and the song later featured in the soundtrack to the film Layer Cake in 2005.  Simon LeBon later performed the song with Pavarotti at a WarChild benefit.[2] The performance was released on home video as Pavarotti & Friends: Together for the Children of Bosnia.  The lyrics to ""Ordinary World"" were written by Simon Le Bon as the second of a trilogy of songs for his late friend David Miles; the others being ""Do You Believe in Shame?"" (1988) and ""Out of My Mind"" (1997).",1
"When it came down to what Duran Duran has had in music, they have absolutely had a lot to prove going into the 90's as real musicians than just boy toys which the music industry labeled about them in song. Still, they had crossed over nicely in the 90's with the music from The Wedding Album, and some of the songs still ignite today like they did back in the 90's. Ordinary World is absolutely no exception. The song is definitely one of their better songs that the group had came out with. I love the rhythm of the song from start to finish. It is definitely one of their better songs they had came out with. If you are absolutely new to Duran Duran's music, this is a great song to download, and if you are a hard core fan of Duran Duran, you'll fall in love with this song and that is a ordinary world.  Song: B+",1
"I have never liked the radio edit for Ordinary world.  If you're going to own this song, get it from THIS album.  Did I say that I disliked the Radio Edited version?",1
"I'm sure everyone was curious to hear this album with ""Ordinary World.""  This song debuted in the late 90's.  Beforehand, all their stuff was from the 80's.  ""...ours is just a little trouble at all..."" I'm sure is a fav lyric by most of their fans. It's not your traditional slow song.  You will also like ""Come Undone.""  I also have the trance version of ""Ordinary  World.""",1
Sometimes you just wanna take a quick trip back to yester-year. This song is as good as it was the day it released!,1
"I heard the song ""Sunrise"" in a Grocery store music system. The OOoh, OOoh chorus is so unmistakable in this song that I had to ask who it was as I had only heard the song once before. A person told me ""Norah Jones"".   I then saw Norah perform this and several other ""Hits"" on Austin City Limits.  I downloaded this and some other female pop singer mp3s  to put together a kind of Pop Diva cd of my own. Norah tops the list. She is also a very skilled piano player. A wonderful talent. Amazon MP3 downloads are a great, low cost way to listen to a favorite vocalist or band.",1
"On of the best (and best known) songs from the Band. I actually like the live version from 'The Last Waltz' more. But since that one is only available if you download the whole album (which I don't want), guess this will do.",1
"I love this song, It is beautiful, and her voice.....no words can explain her voice, but this song I heard her play it live once on SNL and I had to have it.",1
"This song is quaint and calming to listen to.  Nora Jones has a husky, sexy voice that just makes you feel calm.",1
"Song tears my heart out! Somewhat based on true facts, you can feel the pain that was felt during that time in history.",1
"I wanted the one sang by the female hippy.  This is not it, but my fault for not reading more closely.",1
Cute song with cute video to go with it. This guy's voice is great and I've been following others he's done. It doesn't hurt that he looks like he does. I like sending songs like this to my friends in Europe---American Southern/Western men really stand out!,1
"Great beat and chorus.  Reminds you of summer and being at a great ballpark, like PNC Park! Also reminds me of my youth with kids yelling ""swing batter swing batter'!",1
"My husband and I heard this song as part of a sitcom montagoue and then had it stuck in our heads for days- and so had to buy it off amazon mp3s. What we keep repeating when we listen to it in the car: bands and singers from the 80s just can't be beat- this song is so powerful- and so real- and so emotional-  you can literally FEEL the song through the lyrics.  I hear the ticking of the clock I'm lying here the room's pitch dark I wonder where you are tonight No answer on the telephone And the night goes by so very slow Oh I hope that it won't end though Alone  Till now I always got by on my own I never really cared until I met you And now it chills me to the bone How do I get you alone How do I get you alone  You don't know how long I have wanted To touch your lips and hold you tight, oh You don't know how long I have waited And I was gonna tell you tonight But the secret is still my own And my love for you is still unknown Alone  Till now I always got by on my own I never really cared until I met you And now it chills me to the bone How do I get you alone How do I get you alone  How do I get you alone",1
"This is a good song and Heart performed this song well.  Unfortunately, the Wilson Sisters did not write this song.  Some of their original compositions are among the greatest songs in Rock and Roll Music!",1
The ladies from Heart have two of the most powerful voices everywhere. This song is perfect to belt out in the car when no one is listening.  One of the greatest power ballads of the 80s.,1
"Though some think REM were sellouts when they made a record deal I don't think they lost any of their quality, great song.",1
"Remember when dancing was fun, and this song was on? Everybodys doing the locomotion....come on baby do the loco motion",1
"This has always been one of my favorite REM songs, but I only had an LP version.  So I sprung for the mp3 version to play on my computer and portable player.  With the Amazon credit for slower shipping, that works out to free music.  Thanks!",1
"One of the songs I used for background music while I wrote ""Nero's Fiddle"". Very appropriate for the context.",1
"Originally done by Little Eva back in the day, this cover done by GFR holds up,especially with its rock beat.",1
Grand Funk did an awesome job with this old song. Little Eva was outstanding and now this group is outstanding also. Another oldie makes a come back!!!!!,1
this was a cool dance song i remember hearing from back in the 70's . i cool song for sure.,1
"I love this song, such a clean sound and powerful vocals, this song will always be a classic.",1
This song is Sooo BEAUTIFUL.  The lyrics are so meaningful and the melody is so addictive.  The vocals are incredible.  It is one of those songs you will want to hear over and over again.,1
"I haven't heard this one before.  It was in a friend's collection,  I loved it and had to add it to mine.",1
"Rock and roll is the greatest summarizer of this kind of sentiment. Without music, the words of this song might puzzle the kind of readers that Walter Kaufmann was hoping would buy his books on Discovering the Mind. This music matters more than any composer imagined a wired world would love itself to death with.",1
"everytime I play it, it cuts off the end...Not sure, was that how it was recorded? or did my download mess up?",1
Great song by post punk R.E.M.  Great band by the way and this is one of their more popular songs.  Another must have for a solid rock collection.,1
"With December 21, 2012 looming a few days over the horizon, I thought it appropriate to have this song on my Ipod. The gallows humor was irresistible. Now that we have passed the crisis and the world and we still survive, it is still a pleasure to play this tune and say ""bazinga!""",1
"Great song and melody! Leave it to Amazon to have such a wonderfully large list of music to choose from. I found songs, I thought impossible to find.",1
I would love to see them in concert!! I should have got the entire cd.  Must have more money.  Great!,1
Great classic song. Excellent audio quality. Easy no setup streaming from the cloud. Would recommend downloading or streaming it from the Amazon cloud.,1
Good download and no problems with the song once put on my computer and then on to my iPod.  I would buy again from this vendor.,1
I love this it is so beautiful. Andrea Bocelli and Sarah Brightman. Singing this is a duet.,1
"Another great song, that brings back wonderful memories of the important people in my live.  Sarah Brightman & Andrea Bocelli is great in this song.",1
"a touching tribute to my mother. I was not to be with her when she passed in June, but I played the song over and over for her. she loved this song and I hope it was playing in her ears when she left this world. love you and miss you mommy.",1
Great harmony between these two. You can't go wrong with this duo.,1
"I have liked this song for a long time, but I haven't heard of it for some time.  I was perusing the ""bargains"" in the $.69 offerings iand this one was listed.  I listened to it again via the sample tracks, and I realized that it is one that I've been missing listening to.  I bought it right away and was especially pleased at the reasonable price.",1
"I used the SHAZAM app. It gave me the name of the song, the lyrics, and then gave me the option to purchace through Amazon. I'm loving the memories this song brings back!!",1
i love this song beause its fun its relaxing and its blondie shes a great singer and she knows how to sing,1
"I can't tell you this,  I lost my verginty on this song.  I would love the tell you the detail, but they well rate this R-rated.  You got to here this.",1
"Amazing song which is potent in emotion and depth.  The lightness of Sarah Brightman's voice is complemented by the warm, masculine tones of Bocelli.  Very poignant music and lyrics.",1
"Two fantastic vocal talents and a beautifully written song along with some Italian--you can't ask for anything more. This gets me misty eyed each time I hear it. This is simply one of the most touching, beautiful songs that I have ever heard.",1
"This song sends shivers down my spine each time I hear it.  Even if you normally don't listen to classical music, these voices are so good and with such an outstanding arrangement, everyone will enjoy it.",1
"I play Sarah and Andrea, Celine back to back because they both are very beautiful. I just love all three of these artists.",1
After listening to this song I wish I could hear it forever. Andrea Bocelli is very good singer. I just love a lot of his music. I am a big fan. I use to watch him on PBS. Some day I will see him in concert.,1
This is the tune that they play the Bellagio fountains to in Vegas! Very romantic! Enjoy this with a loved one over a bottle of wine.,1
Stepbrothers exposed me to this song and it is a great one. This a great song that will just move you.,1
"this product was exactly what i needed it to be.  It came to be very useful, thanks for the product.",1
"I love listening to this song, it is so beautiful! This is my favorite version of the song. I am glad I downloaded it.",1
Wonderful song and this is one of the most talented women around.  Great voice I have many of her CDs,1
"I love Heart. Grew up with them, lots of great memories.",1
An excellent MP3 of Heart's What About Love.  Thank you Amazon!,1
"One of the top 3 songs done by this sexy female duo, who could sing and play. Boy, I would like to have been up-close and personal with these two, very talented young ladies.",1
"This is another great Ballad from one of my all time favorite groups.  Very professional, and awesome.  Ann Wilson really belts out those ballads!",1
This is a great oldie by Heart.  I remember hearing it in college.  It has good vocals and is not too hard rockish.. just beautiful.,1
I don't know why but I love this song. It seems to go straight to my heart. I don;t even kn0ow the words (Lyrics) yet!!!  Tee Hee isn't that funny.....Mrs. Rebecca Anne Hecht,1
"And, I love being able to purchase all these songs. It reminds me of the old days when we paid 30-cents for a single-45 record. You only bought the songs you liked, *vbs*.",1
"This is a good song and Heart performed this song well.  Unfortunately, the Wilson Sisters did not write this song.  Some of their original compositions are among the greatest songs in Rock and Roll Music!",1
"If you like Heart --- and in particular, this song, then you will love this version of it.  I have an old iRiver that really does have some excellent sound and this digital remaster sounds beautiful on it.",1
i love this song because of good vocals and sultry lyrics and to any of the youngsters out there that want some good songs from the 80's you need to add this to your collection,1
THIS IS A OK SONG IT WAS EASY TO DOWNLOAD WITH NO PROBLEMS AT ALL SURE THE ALBUM MIGHT BE OK,1
As I mentioned on other heart song the album bring back memories from my youth with amazing clarity. I like it.,1
I actually heard Nora Jones on Sesame Street. She sang a modified version of this song for the show. I just had to look her up and found this popular song. I had heard it before but didn't know who sang it. What a voice! I bought a few additional songs of her's after this one.,1
"Its soft melody sets me to a pleasant mood with its slight variation of notes and a voice that is as comforting as the sea breeze. For me, this song is best played after a stressful day or before bedtime which drifts me into calmness and hypnosis.",1
I've been playing the heck out of this song ever since I bought it.  Love It.,1
"Another very popular song from Nora Jones, one of my favorites. Her usual slow and easy pace if very soothing for beautiful listening.",1
"What a timeless piece despite being of this millennium.  It's rather simple because there's no profound depth of meaning other than let's be together, fully.... alone.  Nothing more, nothing less.  Sweet.",1
I had heard this song before and liked it but when it was recommended in a book I was reading I reconnected with it and had to own it this time around,1
"Beautiful to look at, heavenly to hear, Norah Jones never fails to please, and doesn't fail here.  An asset to Jazz.",1
I love this song. I love her voice. I wonder why she doesn't get much publicity. This song showcases a talented artist. Relaxing music.,1
"This song is perfectly performed, lyrics are unexpected and quirky in a romantic manner.  The melody is a bit dark the contradiction of the juxtaposition of the whole story makes the love song all the more delightful and the longing is sweet and promising.  the girl can sing and delivers the lyric and the melody with all the nuance and emotion to suspend the listener within the story.  She is a quiet and compelling force , I don't of another performer who could have pulled it off so quietly but blow you away.  Maybe Bette Midler at the outside. Again it stands the test of time, she makes some intelligent choices.",1
works great. Downloaded with no issues. good price. Have had this song for several months. Had no issues at all so far.,1
Norah Jones is a great singer/songwriter.  This is a great download.  It brings back memories which always makes me smile.,1
I love listening to Norah Jones when I'm unwinding after a long day.  This is one of my favorite of her songs.,1
"This song is nice and soothing song if you are needing the calmness.  The artist has several good songs out there, this one just makes em feel calm.",1
I love this song and was excited to find it on Amazon. I was even happier that the process to download it to my computer and then into my iTunes library to put on my iPod was quite simple as well!,1
Listening to oldies on the radio.  It brought back memories from the past.  I decided I needed this in my music library.,1
"This is a good song and Heart performed this song well.  Unfortunately, the Wilson Sisters did not write this song.  Some of their original compositions are among the greatest songs in Rock and Roll Music!",1
This single probably represents the all time top of the game for Wilson sisters Ann and Nancy. A great cut!,1
I have purchased other music by Heart and love it but this song was not included in my other CD so I wanted it so much I purchased it by itself. Haunting melody to me. Always loved it. So wonderful to pick exactly what we want to hear from days gone by and I am so grateful for the affordability as well as opportunity to find these songs available to purchase and add to my Amazon Cloud/music library. Love it!!!,1
"I used to play this all the time.  When I started browsing on the Amazon MP3 selections, this jumped right out and into my computer!  Awesome ballad.",1
"And I really enjoyed the movie ""Gorilla's in the Mist.""  Heart has a beautiful voice and beautiful lyrics.  Can't go wrong with them.",1
"I remember when the album with this tune dropped.  I recall this tune did well on the Billboards.  It's not a slow song but it does go pretty slow, making it a well put together tune.",1
"Just like with Ordinary world, you need this album version of Come undone, it is awesome and much better than getting it from some greatest hit album.",1
Downloaded the MP3 at some point for someone or myself. Good Song.,1
Nora Jones has a beautiful voice.  You can't help but feel the emotions of the lyrics meld with hers.,1
"The Creek is one of the Band's staple song. One of the very few that made it onto the music charts and others are familiar with. Not surprising considering its one of their best and I like it. Check out the live version on ""The Last Waltz"" album.",1
"Used this song in a video, I made about my family, all in fun. Love the story. Worth the 99 cent.",1
love anything this man sings again why must I type all this when all I need to say is I loved it,1
I love Trace Adkins & love the ease of downloading from Amazon! It's so fast & easy to get my favorite music on my device!,1
"I love the background music and the 60's atmosphere in the lyrics.  The name Cripple Creek always made me think of Colorado, not Louisiana, but the image is appropriate in a hard and full life for a man.",1
Absolutely a wonderful album that captures the essence of the time.  I had almost forgotten how mesmerizing the words and melody are.,1
I love it. This song is now in my music library. Thanks.,1
There's nothing like Jethro Tull !!  The flute sounds so good in this particular song of Tull's !!  For all of us who grew up listening to Jethro Tull.......we  know how good this CD is !!  I highly recommend it to every music lover!! ENJOY!!,1
"Would go to the park with friends, to the movies, out to eat, or to a party and this song was always being played. Once you hear it you have to have it to enjoy again and again.",1
Again this is for my mate and he likes it but I just like it.  It was great in its time.,1
"Music is all very personal and I'm not sure why I'm being asked to review it.  What I may love, another person will not, but I'm tired of seeing it on my ""Review Purchases"" screen, so I really love this song.",1
Norah Jones is an incredible talent and this song is indicative of what she can do.  It was her biggest hit and one of the most beautiful songs that has come along in a long time.,1
"We love you Norah, daughter of Ravi Shankar, the great sitar player and mentor of the Beatles.",1
She has a rare voice. I wish she would put out more music,1
"I don't buy many songs online, but I bought this one because I love it! :) I would totally recommend it to you!",1
"Love Norah, she is a singular individual artist with an undeniable gift. Beautiful sultry voice with so much emotion and pure talent. Just beautiful!!",1
works great. Downloaded with no issues. good price. Have had this song for several months. Had no issues at all so far.,1
This is a beautiful song and so well done. The message hits home -- I been there and didn't know why myself!!!,1
good version of the song.... Sound quality was good and it was what I was expecting.... I am a frequent downloader of Amazon songs and have had good experiences with it.,1
I bought this to make a ringtone.  The first 10 seconds of this song is just priceless.  I always get compliments when people hear my ringer.,1
It is music so it is pretty much good if this is your taste  Summary: buy of simply find it on you tube,1
A great track from a great artist. Be sure to check out rollingbaby.com for baby stroller related topics.,1
"A GREAT track!!! Love the energy in this song. Always enjoy listening to it when I am on a long drive on the interstate. Glad to hear it in Star Trek: ""Beyond"".",1
Whether you're slaying bodies in multiplayer or cruisin' with the wind whipping through your beard this is just the right amount of loud and rowdy to get the job done. Now go stack those bodies.,1
"The song is awesome, but be aware that this ""clean"" version does not simply mute the swear in the line ""f***ing thorn in my side"", but does an annoyingly noticeable skip over the sound.",1
"it was easy to find, it was easy to download and one of my more favorite songs from the 70's-80's",1
"I used to listen to them while i was still in high school.  Oh, for the halcyon days of youth!",1
"i received this album with no problems still waiting for the Boston album to download , show up or get a credit back for it.",1
"Sounds just like a digital file of a song, which is exactly what it is.  For Fox News Chairman Roger Ailes, who has succeeded in turning angry working Americans against one another instead of his biollionaire employer and the wealthy advertisers who bankroll them..",1
Helps as good mental health treatment for anger.  Let it out. Let go. Yell.,1
The Beastie Boys anti-authority rant and still it makes sense today...,1
"I like the song and miss hearing the Beastie Boys, so I bought it. The download process is a little cumbersome but the song is good.",1
i like song. perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect perfect gthte donr bbj,1
"If I didn't want it, I would not have bought it.",1
One of the best ever rock songs. You can't go wrong with this song!,1
I love it. This song is now in my music library. Thanks.,1
Grand Funk Railroad is a classic 1970's Rock and Roll Band. I know. I was around back then.,1
This is a good song. On the original album it advises 'play at maximum volume',1
"Another tune from the past, you know when artist still wrote songs, played instruments and used their own voices.",1
I got this for my MP3 player & loved it. Great sound & enjoy it very much. I will download more,1
Who doesn't like this song? A great American song by a great American band. The remastering does what technology couldn't do back in the day.,1
"Song from the album of same name, one of two albums produced by Todd Rungren in 1973 on Capital label, and went platinum.  Remastered in 2002 and is still a classic from the Seventies.  Doesn't get much better than Grand Funk.",1
I love this song. Used to here it on the radio all the time in the 70's. Grand Funk rules,1
this was for sure one of the cooler songs i remember hearing from back in the 70's . nice add on to my player.,1
"This was one of Grand Funk's real anthems and one of their most played songs before their big hit period began with We're An American Band in the fall of '73. Grand Funk was never very popular with the critics, largely, I think, because their music was fairly simple and they were real crowd-pleasers, and showed no greater ambitions than that. But these qualities made them vastly popular with the general public who gave them six million-selling albums at a time when AM radio wouldn't play their songs. This song would be heard at rock concerts all over, especially the outdoor concerts. If it was a big concert Grand Funk themselves might be playing it as they toured a lot. But many outdoor summer concerts had good regional or local bands and all of them played this song too. It really captures the feeling of a rock concert circa 1970-71.",1
I had no problems with the download. I mainly listen to classic rock and had no problems ever. Thank you very much!,1
This was a song in a time of chaos and confusion. It was always one I could turn on and get lost in for a moment.,1
"This is from Tull's ""Aqua Lung"". This album was one of the greatest in classic Rock and a game changer, This new mix sounds great even in MP3 format which is not my favorite.",1
One of the all time great songs.  Who wouldn't want this on their computer?  Never gets tired and the intro is terrific,1
Maybe its the reality shows with Bret Micheals but you think that after nearly dying this man would wake up and stay with his family and just plain grow up but the song is okay. I like hearing it every now and again so that was why I downloaded it...but him as a human being...definately not a Bret Micheals fan.,1
"Beautiful song I love it, it's one of my top favorite songs.",1
"You know the original song, we all do, the remaster is even better on the guitar.",1
"Loved this tune the first time I heard Norah Jones sing it and love it still.  Just the right amount of everything in a tune that is sultry, and  visceral you can see the cold water flat and smell the world outside and in ......the song is short but it reads like a novel and you want to read it again in case you missed the happy ending.  Great stuff.",1
"Poison is one of our favorite bands, and Every Rose Has Its Thorn has a deep meaning to it, it is a song I listen to every day",1
This product is as advertised. Satisfactorily made and serves the purpose for which it was designed. Would recommend it to others.,1
"Love Bret, love this song, and it's so true on so many issues. I think there isn't anything it doesn't pertain to, love, work, kids, life itself, love it and it is now in my collection",1
"Late 80's Monster Ballad! Love it! Been wanting to do this song for over 20 years, and now, I'm singing AND playing drums to it in my band!",1
Its music so not much to say I wouldn't buy it unless I liked it. I definitely enjoy the ability to buy individual songs via mp3 instead of having to waste money buying an entire album.,1
Just added to my music collection always listened  to it .. guess it depends what kind of music you like love all the songs of 60ies 70ies 80ies,1
"Classic rock at its finest.  what more to say, I have to write seven more words... now the last four!",1
"...love it, love her, love to.  Nora Jones always brings her best, and doesn't disappoint in this soulful lover's plea.",1
The first time I heard this song I just smiled.  Definately written by someone who had some fun growing up.,1
I'm not a big country fan but I love this song!  It has a good beat and really funny lyrics.,1
with out the cross there would be no pentecost...Matt Redman has a great voice ..a gift from the Lord that he shares with everyone...,1
"What a wonderful song and rendition! You'll find yourself reflecting on all the Lord has done for you, how blessed we are to have Him, humbled by what He has done for us, and finding yourself stopping to just praise Him and thank Him!",1
Story-telling country at it's best. I love how it captures the spirit of the young and restless type of love we experience as teenagers.,1
Great audio quality love this song and listen to it all the time on my phone computer and my ps3,1
Love love this song.  Dierks is so easy to listen to and his music is always on a couple of my playlists.,1
This is a classic C&W ballad of love taking a wicked turn for the poor guy being led in sin by his bad-girl girlfriend.,1
Great song from a VERY talented artist who I hope to see live in concert soon. Very high quality sound,1
I listen to music to suit my mood.  I like driving to toe tapping music and Dierks Bentley gives me that,1
There's a reason for Dierks Bentley being on the charts all the time. This song's dynamics are nothing short of sensational. He goes from almost no instrumentation to rockin' the song hard! What's not to like?,1
Older song I didn't have for a Birthday Party I was DJing for people that requested it! Have most of Dierk's music but not this one!,1
"Had to buy this when I first heard it in the car. Really gets you going, motivated and have a good time.",1
One of David Bowie's classic songs. Brings back great memories.  Whats not to like and the price is great as well.,1
"Ground control to Major Tom.  That's all you need to know.  One of a kind song, belongs in everyone's collection.  Ground control to Major Tom.",1
"This is a classic, rock n roll tune that is surreal with the idea of Major Tom floating away to die in the void of space all alone. Very sad tune but extremely good all the same. David Bowie is certainly one of the most underrated Musicians out there in music. I'm a HUGE fan of his Diamond Dogs work and this album is another one that is phenomenal.",1
"I'm sorry I did not know of this song sooner.  I actually came to like it after seeing the movie, The Secret Life of Walter Mitty.",1
Gonna miss this person and his contributions to music and acting... REST IN PEACE David !!!,1
What can you say about David Bowie that hasn't already been said a million times?,1
"Ground control to major Tom...if this song wasn't too amazing, nobody would try to cover it over and over again.",1
"Everyone should own this to listen to whenever they like! Brings me right back to the ""old days""-but is still fresh and current!",1
This was the song that played in the movie 2001 space odyssey. which I loved listening to  and also in Mr. Deeds movie,1
"I got the song to make my own soundtrack of the movie ""Rock of Ages"" with the original version of the song.",1
Classic 80's hair band song. I personally listen to it when I want to get pumped up about a night out or just feel a dancing type mood.,1
Its music so not much to say I wouldn't buy it unless I liked it. I definitely enjoy the ability to buy individual songs via mp3 instead of having to waste money buying an entire album.,1
"And, I love being able to purchase all these songs. It reminds me of the old days when we paid 30-cents for a single-45 record. You only bought the songs you liked, *vbs*.",1
This is the radio version of this song that I was looking for. This is the version I remember and wanted to buy and that is exactly what I got. I have never had a problem with sound quality when buying from Amazon. I thought the digital remaster had a better sound than the original recording.,1
Poison is a great band. Love their music. I would highly recommend checking them out and ordering a download or 2.,1
Just a great song for the him & her portion of rehearsal video. It applied perfectly to the bride & groom.... Used it as one of 5 in video,1
"I love Keith Urban and purchased this song for my wedding montage!  We ended up going with Tim McGraws ""My best friend"" and used this for our wedding montage for after!  LOVE IT!",1
"it is such a beautiful song, you don't hear it enough on the radio which is a shame. I really  love this song, we used it as our wedding song.",1
this is my husband and my most favorite song and we had been looking for it.  thanks for having it on your online music.,1
Well what can I say? This song is awesome. I like Toby Mac. I listen to this song anywhere I go.,1
I think this song is great so I added it to my playlist immediately and have praised the Lord with it everyday since then.,1
"Ok, people who are dogging the snot out of his album, do you really expect a band NOT to change their style?  If so, go listen to Marduk, Gorgoroth, Immortal, Nevermore or some half-baked crappy bands that bring shame to metal.  Any band that has potential and wants to keep their edge and notoriety needs to experiment.  They did a beautiful job with this album, and I love every song on it.  My favorites are ""Stabbing The Drama"" ""Nerve"" and the bonus track ""Wherever Thorns May Grow.""  I'm not saying that those who challenge them are wrong or stupid, I'm just saying that based on your reviews, you seem to want repetition and monotony.  Sorry, but true listeners don't want that.  You may as well just buy one album and not bother buying others.  This is a must have for all metal and Soilwork fans!!!",1
"i might look at this album differently from most Soilwork listeners. I would say _Stabbing the Drama_ is a big improvement over _Natural Born Chaos_ and _Figure Number Five_, and it's sort of a medium between the two. Just for reference, _A Predator's Portrait_ is one of my all time favorite metal discs, simply perfect. _Steelbath Suicide_ and _Chainheart Machine_ are also fantastic. all three of those are brutal and furious. That said, I even liked FNF for the most part, because of the vocals and catchy songs, but the guitars and drums and METALNESS of it seemed more half-hearted IMO, a downgrade from _Natural Born Chaos_ but that album had its own shortcomings like sounding pretty homogeneous.  _Stabbing the Drama_ has the same catchy aspect as these previous albums (NBC/FNF) but the writing on the whole seems stronger. Heck, this band's songwriting is downright outstanding in my opinion, they write GREAT catchy metal songs, their melodic acumen is outstanding and Speed is an extremely empathetic vocalist. The album shows a tremendous refinement of the band's main direction for the last while, and if you take the last three albums as a class, this is the most well-rounded and best-written accomplishment of those. but here the songs have more variety and better quality from beginning to end (i haven't heard the newest one, _Sworn to a Great Divide_)  I would honestly think of this has heavy pop music, which to me isn't a bad thing although such a description is probably a major turn-off to most people.  like pop music, the main focus is the vocals and the hooks. The general form of structure and arrangement is pretty straightforward, and by now Speed's approach to vocals is pretty predictable. Speed's voice is amazing though, whether the harsh voice or clean voice, and he's gotten much better with each album. That said, the music is much more... i dunno, fleshed out than the last few. Fat, chunky-choppy riffs and absolutely AMAZING drumming (forget Ranta, the new drummer is a fiend, did i mention that?), and very tasteful synths all drive the hooks home with amazing force behind the vocalist in the spotlight. pop music, even really good pop music, doesn't really show this kind of deadly chops.  I'd say if you really _disliked_ everything since APP, STD won't change your mind -- BUT if you liked the general approach of the previous two albums but thought they could be a little better SOMEHOW, then you should pick this up if you haven't because it rules, although i wager the fan likes or would like NBC more than this one. I think this is just as addictive as those, but more well written so it has much better lasting power. i personally have deep regrets about not getting it until very recently.",1
"If there was one thing that Soilwork had shown during its first few albums, was the bands ability to mix so many forms of metal into one, and make it work. When I heard the first few works by this band, I had thought they were the most unique band since ""Hypocrisy"". Even though I am not die hard fan of Soilwork, I still enjoyed what they had to offer, and found myself sneaking in a listen every now and then. As the albums and time went on, it was apparent that Soilwork was starting to change over their musical style. They had seemed to abando some of their Death and Thrash metal sound, and were almost crossing into a more Nu Metal sound. That is fine. Even though some Metal Heads critize Nu Metal as being generic and poppy, that is a really broad statement. There are some Nu Metal bands that are fantastic. True, some are generic and sound like every other, but some try their best to create that sound, while still creating thier own ""Bells and Whistles"" to stand out from the rest. So on to ""Stabbing the Drama"" When I first heard it, I was ashamed that Soilwork would even be dabbling around with this generic sound. Gone was everything they had built, only to be torn down my genric pop Nu Metal core, almost like the band was releasing something for the masses of pop radio, and not for the fans who so dug the sounds that made them stand out from the rest. True, there are fans and people that will love this album, but I tend to be really critical of bands that have a ton of talent, and then release an album of this calibur. Korn, Metallica, Machine Head, Pantera and Coal Chamber are all bands that I had either loved the debuts, or some of the bands early works. Then it seemed that they crossed over in sound, and in my opinion, this was done not because of a want to make something different (most of us know that as we get older, we all seem to have changes or long for something different musically)but they did it to sell more albums and appeal to the masses. Some of those bands recovered, some didnt, but the damage was still done. So the conclusion is, what will you think of ""Stabbing the Drama"" It depends on what you are looking for. New to Soilwork? Like a more generic Sound or simple Metal? Yes, you might like it. Even fans of Soilwork might appricate the change here. I look at this as strictly a marketing gimmic. I also found myself not liking one single track. Not a ONE! Change can be good, but here, change isn't good. Sometimes it is just better to leave well enough alone.",1
"There has been a lot of competition among metal bands these past few years, and so many of the bands offer nothing at all new to the metal scene. Plus, it doesn't necessarily make it easier if your band is from Sweden, because there are also several Swedish metal bands (i.e. Arch Enemy, Meshuggah, In Flames, etc.)  Before I heard their music, I had Soilwork pegged as just another metalcore band; but then, on an impulse buy, I gave ""Stabbing the Drama"" a listen. And when I did, I was very pleasantly surprised. This C.D. isn't 100% new or innovative, but it's melodic, and that's quite refreshing in this day and age.  The guitars are fiery and crunchy, but the vocals are what make these songs pleasing to the ears. Singer Bjorn Strid doesn't quite have a soulful voice, but it is tuneful and quite impressive. He switches back and forth between angry and aggressive to harmonic and clean. Sometimes, as is the case with tracks five and six, he can sing melodically even when the backing music is heavy.  The title track is a personal favorite because it has rapid stop-start riffs and drumming which is vaguely reminiscent of a jackhammer. ""One With the Flies"" is a punching rhythm with cascading riffs, and a nice, melodic guitar solo. ""Weapon of Vanity"" has scorching, blowtorch riffs, and ""Nerve"" begins with thunderous guitar noise and dreary vocals. ""Stalemate"" has a sprinting rhythm with running riffs and fast, thumping drums. ""Observation Slave"" has a lot of clean singing (some of the vocals sound distant), alongside riffs which are extra crunchy. ""Blind Eye Halo"" features grooving riffs, fast snare drumming, and back-to-back guitar solos. Finally, ""If Possible,"" has more fast, surging, stop-start, punching riffs, but it ends with some light guitar plucking.  There's one thing that drags this C.D. down, which is that most of the songs follow the same structure: raging vocals in the verses and singing clearly for the chorus. This structure becomes quite repetitive and predictable, but all in all, I'm very glad I decided to give this C.D. a shot, because it is much more than typical metalcore. Soilwork deserve to have much success with it, because ""Stabbing the Drama"" makes the band stand out among other modern metal bands. So, if you've given up on In Flames, and you're not sure which other metal bands to listen to (since there are so many), I definitely recommend you give ""Stabbing the Drama"" a shot.",1
"I hear people complaining how bad this album is, that ""Soilwork have turned to crappy nu-metal or they're not melo-death!"" Seriously, if you think THIS album sucks, go buy Metallica's horrible excuse for a new album ""St. Anger"", or that that new album from Limp Bizkit. True ""Stabbing The Drama"" isn't Soilwork's best album, but is sure blows the previous release ""Figure Number Five"" right out of the water, and at least the drummer doesn't sound like he's banging his drum sticks on trash cans, and that guitarists Ola Frenning and Peter Wichers still know how to solo. Now that I got that out of my chest, I will now review the album. 2005's ""Stabbing The Drama"", Soilwork's sixth album is one of the best metal albums I bought this year. Like I said before, this blows FNF out of the water. Even thought the bass and keyboards are somewhat drowned out (due to the bit faulty production), this album still has great vocals from Speed Strid, catchy guitar riffs and some nice solos from Peter Wichers and Ola Frenning, and some very good drumming as well. My favorite songs on here are ""Stabbing The Drama"", ""One With The Flies"" (which is very catchy), ""Weapon Of Vanity"", ""Stalemate"", ""Nerve"", ""Distance"", and ""Blind Eye Halo"" (which is an excellent dose of traditional Soilwork brutality and aggression).  themetalbeast's track ratings:  1. Stabbing The Drama: 5/5  2. One With The Flies: 5/5 (Very catchy, nice solo)  3. Weapon Of Vanity: 5/5  4. The Crestfallen: 4/5  5. Nerve: 5/5  6. Stalemate: 5/5  7. Distance: 5/5  8. Observation Slave: 4/5  9. Fate In Motion: 4/5  10. Blind Eye Halo: 5/5 (Very aggressive song, I love it)  11. If Possible (Bonus Track): 5/5  12. Wherever Thorns May Grow (Bonus Track): 5/5  The Verdict:  Is ""Stabbing The Drama"" a horrible sell-out album, an underrated masterpiece, or just a misunderstood album. Truly a misunderstood, underrated masterpiece, and one of 2005's best. You might be disappointed if you're acustomed to Soilwork's older albums, but if you're a true Soilwork fan, or just have a great taste in music, feel free to purchase this.",1
"I plan on going to Ozzfest this year, despite the unusually lackluster lineup (I'm really only going to see In Flames, Mastodon, Rob Zombie, Killswitch Engage, Mudvayne, Maiden, and of course Sabbath), so I've been trying to get into more bands that are on this year's tour. I've heard nothing but good things about Soilwork (this was before this particular album's release), and I knew they were (supposedly) melodic death metal, and being that melo death is more or less my favorite genre of metal I decided I've give them a shot, but I waited for the release of this album, which I had seen advertised, before I actually purchased anything, as I wanted to get this first. That worked with Dark Tranquillity (""Character"" is a jaw-dropping album), but maybe I should've started with an older release with Soilwork.  After all the rave reviews I've seen of their past albums, and simply their label of melodic death, I expected to hear some complex and beautiful music on this album. I really didn't get it. While I'm not saying that Soilwork doesn't have talent, I'm just saying that if they do have it, they're not showing it as much as they should be on this record. The songwriting is bland as can be, like a pop rock record: most, if not all, of the songs are in intro riff, verse, chorus, verse, chorus, bridge, chorus formula (with a few exceptions), and most of the riffs are fairly simple and frankly uninspired, not at all melodic death-like. Well, at this point I realize Soilwork, at least on this record, isn't really a melodic death band anymore. While In Flames abandoned their classic melo-death sound long ago, I still believe that they make great, though less complicated and though-provoking, music, ""Soundtrack to Your Escape"" being one of my favorite albums of 2004. But it just doesn't work with Soilwork. I honestly can't listen to this album long without getting bored and putting in something else. Lead vocalist Speed no doubt has a good voice, but it bores me, it just seems too much like something you'd hear on a commercial radio rock album. And I have no problem with clean vocals in metal, but Speed's voice really just doesn't do anything for me. He sings on the majority of the album, but he'll also scream every now and then, but I don't see anything special in that either.  The main problem with this album is it's just too predictable, too dull, too uninspired, too generic, and way too simple. The album has some catchy tracks (the choruses to ""Weapon of Vanity"" and ""Nerve"" have gotten stuck in my head at random times ever since I first heard them), they just don't stand out too much. If you're gonna be a metal band, you gotta make yourself noticeable and show all the talent you've got, and when you have bands like Mastodon and Children of Bodom to compete with, you've really gotta give it all you got. Maybe I'm just judging too hard, but I've given this album time to see if it grew on me, and I still have the same opinion of it I did when I first heard it. But since I've heard so many good things about their past releases, I'll probably pick one of them up sometime in the future, because I really do want to get into Soilwork before I see them at the `Fest.",1
"After spending the past few years getting all the nu-metal trash thrown at me, it seems that that fad has finally waned down.  This new ""metal-core"" fad in metal today will most likely suffer the same fate, but for bands like Soilwork, this passing fad may find them mainstream success.  After the disappointing ""Figure Number Five"", Soilwork return with ""Stabbing the Drama"", which is a vast improvement, and while it may not harken back to the ""Natural Born Chaos"" or even ""Steelbath Suicide"" days, this album still manages to be a more than solid headbanger.  The title track features an incredibly catchy chorus, while ""One With the Flies"", ""Stalemate"", and ""If Possible"" are great as well.  However, there are times on ""Stabbing the Drama"" that it sounds too mainstream aimed, especially on ""Distance"".  Despite that, and many of the negative reviews featured here, ""Stabbing the Drama"" is an intelligent metal album, which is something the genre so desperately needs with all the Killswitch Engage's and Atreyu's running around today.  All in all, if you've never heard Soilwork before, check out ""Steelbath Suicide"" or ""Natural Born Chaos"", and then give ""Stabbing the Drama"" a stab.",1
THIS IS A OK SONG IT WAS EASY TO DOWNLOAD WITH NO PROBLEMS AT ALL  THE ALBUM MIGHT BE OK,1
"just brings back memories, and i love that it was remastered so it sounds way better than my cassette copy!",1
This is the same studio version from the original album but it's remastered (so it sounded better through the speakers). It is not from a concert and is not a live version.,1
Its music so not much to say I wouldn't buy it unless I liked it. I definitely enjoy the ability to buy individual songs via mp3 instead of having to waste money buying an entire album.,1
This was perfect. It was totally awesome hands down. I would not have and issues in getting this again. Perfect.,1
"This must be the most popular karaoke song of all time; when I tried to find the ""original"" release, I found over 200 listings, many instrumentals by myriads of different groups.  I really got the wrong version of this song; I would have rather had the original that he sang on a 45.  This isn't it; it is a LIVE version; it's not bad, but see if you can find the original if you know the song well.  If you never heard the original, this version is fine, but for most of us, we can distinguish the slight differences.  My problem was I was not paying close enough attention; you only get 30 seconds to make up your mind, and this version sounded pretty good for the first 30 seconds.",1
Title says it all as Jesus is all we do need!,1
This is a beautiful song! I added it to my worship playlist that goes with me everywhere. This artist is becoming a new favorite.,1
An awesome song. God is great. He gave us his son.,1
Jeremy Camp does a really nice job on this song. You can find yourself singing along with him. Great song.,1
"I needed a single song for lent with my children's worship group. This one got all my four year olds ready for the story of perfect love! Buy it, we need it.",1
"First heard this at a funeral and was so moved I had to find it.  I start my day with this song.  Puts it all into perspective.  And his version is the best one I found.  ""When I come to die, just give me Jesus!""",1
Love his music and his love for Christ!  You can only love Jeremy once you hear him sing to the Lord!,1
"Great song, easy purchase and use of just as quick and simple, not to mention great options to save on your computer with free back-up on Amazon...great place to buy from!",1
"That means Six Feet Under, if you were wondering.  This song is what the producers used over the last few minutes of the series finale, as Claire drives into her future through the desert and we also get glimpses of decades to come, as various Fisher family members and friends pass on.  Sia's voice is a bit weak and breathy at times--it bugs me a little--but overall the song is beautifully rendered, with a heartbreaking piano bit and simple yet powerful lyrics.  It was the perfect choice for one of the best TV series endings I have ever seen.  I downloaded the MP3 right after viewing it.",1
i like the song but I'm still trying to figure out the moral of the song.,1
"Breathe me is a simple amazing song full of much needed heart and soul something  mainstream music has lost over the years It's a little dark but, still very tragic and beautiful  It's a perfect but, damaged pop ballad. If it doesn't bring up any unresolved feelings inside you then maybe you have never really lived  10/10 If your a fan of the earlier work of Tori Amos, Fiona Apple, Jewel, & Heather Nova it's a must!",1
One of the most beautiful songs I have ever heard. It's beautiful and spellbinding.,1
Oh man! Sia is the best and this song does not fall short! She sings with so much feeling she can bring tears to your eyes! buy it!!!!!,1
"I absolutely love this song. It transports me somewhere else when I listen to it. I cannot speak much about other of her songs, but this one is just fantastic.",1
I heard this song on a show and I used my Shazam app right away to find out what it was. Such a great song to really get you thinking and listening to the lyrics! Great for times when you just need to relax!,1
Bought this because it is one of my favorite songs which I now have the pleasure of owning  with only $.99,1
I am really glad they have started remastering these old songs.  I enjoyed them when they came out and they still sound great.,1
Great 80's tune and good quality sound! Whats not to love! All the tunes sound great that have been digital remastered.,1
"Why would I lie?  Why would I lie?  Well, you may not have been driving to Hampton Beach with me, in the Slyboat after the Prom back in '83, but this song may hold a place in your personal soundtrack, as well.  Roll back the memory tapes to see if you can recall, and if you can't, then perhaps you should buy your own copy.",1
"another one for the collection, I think we have all loved someone out of our league, but love always wins. Love the song and in my collection of memories now",1
"Great song, Brings back some old memories, Keeps life in perspective, Don't judge a book by its cover. Thanks Johnny.",1
"Talk about putting you whole soul into a song!  Wow, Johnny Rivers does that and then some.  If you like beautiful music, get this.",1
"I have liked this song for years, along with several other Johnny Rivers tunes.  Listening to it again, I am reminded how much the world has changed in the last 40 years, and not necessarily for the better.",1
This is one of Rivers all time hits.  It is a must have for any person who grew up during that day.,1
"Love this song!!  Never knew the title...until recently....used to listen to it on the radio all the time but never knew who sang it or what the title was....glad one day I saw the title on tv....then went to Amazon mp3 to locate it....and bought it right away!!  this song never gets old...just has one of those catchy melodies....that era produced such wonderful timeless music....that no matter what generation you are, you can love this tune!!",1
This song is a good song and it is a Quiet Storm type of song. I have not heard this song in decades so I have it on my mp3 player and that way I will hear it.,1
"First let it be said that I've made a switch.  Having a limited budget, I have owned an MP3 player for fifteen months now.  One of the drawbacks has been figuring out a way to load my I-Tunes to my favorite personal music device.  With C.D.'s it's a breeze, but what about those times when you don't want to commit to an entire album, but go for the single essentials?  Amazon offers a solution with downloaded music that can be formatted for I-Pods AND MP3 players.  Happily, I've been in pop music bliss as I hear some of my favorite songs come in MP3 player clarity from their downloads.  Enticed by a Metamorpho review, I decided to head down memory lane and pick up a jazzy and formidable piece of rock music.  ""The Wanderer"" gets my vote as the best Dion song, and, as I refuse to contradict the merits of Meta's illuminating review, I can still wait for tomorrow to pick up the other nuggets I've sampled of his on Amazon when I get extra greenbacks.  Not to date myself, but it is quite a blessing to discover the glory of music in different phases:  a clock radio (childhood), a radio tape-recorder (puberty) to stereo and Walkman (college), and now the splendor and clarity of MP3 player resonance and selection.  (For the uninitiated, TAKE NOTE:  Write down the directions as you initiate your downloading capabilities from Amazon.  Download the complimentary starter song they offer (You may say, ""I didn't order that!"" Notice it says ""Free Download"" to start your format.  Then, play the song from its selected option.  (See if your Windows Media Player  plays it and capture it in your library.)  When it does and you've captured it, you're in business. Then, you can download songs off Amazon.  (I would also advise you to listen to the songs before you download them.  Make sure you hear the version of the song you want. [I almost downloaded a new version of The Crystals' ""He's a Rebel,"" a no-no in my book.)  Being somewhere between a newbie and computer whiz kid, I admit it's a little hard to start on Amazon.  (I had to pay twice for Cyndi Lauper's ""All Through the Night"" before I got the hang of it.)  If you write down the directions, it is easy after your first download and capture.  So pay attention and ""Don't do as I do, do as I say!""  Having the will and way, I am happy to take the Amazon MP3 Player plunge.  Give it a try and you will, too.",1
"Ok song, but too much nonsinging during the song. Not very danceable.",1
I would not have bought the song unless I first liked it. Download plays back good on my MP3 player.,1
"Enough said a talent that only hung around for the 50-60 era, still performs butnot the samekind of music, love the sound",1
"I LOVE THIS SONG ALWAYS HAVE,IT'S GOT THE BEST BEATS AND IT TAKES IN A TIME WHERE MY FAMILY GREW UP AND IT'S FROM ANNETTE FINCIELLO AND FRANKY VALLEY DAYS. I GUESS I SPELLED THEIR NAMES RIGHT, ANYWAY I USE TO WATCH JUST ABOUT ALL THEIR SHOWS AND THIS SONG IS SO COOL.DION'S VOICE SOND SO MUCH LIKE EH WAS REALLY HURT BY THIS SUE AND HE IS STILL CONFESSING HIS LOVE FOR HER EVEN THOUGH HE TELLS THE GUYS TO KEEP AWAY FROM RUN AROUND SUE, HONESTLY BECAUSE SHE'S STILL HIS.",1
Same grandson that likes music by Chainz 2 and Drake also wanted this song for his MP3 player!  Love Chris LeDoux and this song is great!!  My husband is also a big LeDoux fan!!,1
Gave five stars--I think Chris Ledoux does such an amazing job with the song!  I love his voice and I am sorry he is no longer with us--will be missed greatly. Loved all his songs that I ave heard.,1
This is a good product.  Filled the need for which i was searching.  I give it four stars as my rating.,1
Wonderful song. I love his music and hated to see him go. I added this to my music collection at the suggestion of my grandson and I am glad I did.,1
"I liked the lyrics to this song, and the singing is excellent too. I  heard this song at a friend's home, and I liked the lyric to it. I am glad I got this one.",1
"always great to hear, always loved this on the radio, if people can remember that, the early rock an roll era, he has other great songs to hear too,",1
"lets face it, some men and women are not ready for a relationship",1
I would not have bought the song unless I first liked it. Download plays back good on my MP3 player.,1
"these songs brought back memories for me i enjoyed listening to them , play them just for romance to come back once in a while for husband , the song sounded great the download was fast",1
"You have to be a Baby Boomer to appreciate this music. Well, at least you were around in the Fifties. I like most of Dion's songs, this would be my next favorite, although they are all pretty darn good.",1
"We know the sixties are almost revered amongst music fans, but not all the groups were on target. Dion and the Belmonts just didn't do it for me.",1
"This was my theme song when I was a teenager. If you like classic rock, then this song is a must for your collection.",1
This song takes me back to my listening youth. He is great at taking people home to a better time then nowadays. Very happy with all the transaction.,1
I remember this song out when I was a kid.  I just had to have it for my MP3 player,1
Maybe the original version of this song?  I can still remember my sister listening to Leif Garret singing this song thinking he wrote it.,1
"first i love the artist ,but had not heard the song,  after my husband died, i had a dream of him fixing on a car with the radio playing very loud and this was the song playing. I LOVE IT",1
What the world needs is more love songs.  Great song!  Very inspiring. Good clean music for relationships and for family.,1
I was young when this song came out and it still touched my heart. My husband dedicated this to me when we first got together and it is still one of my #1 songs.,1
This again is an oldie that I love and Freddie Jackson is one of my favorite artist from the past.  Love it.,1
A very smooth and lovely song performed by an unique lady with one of the best singing voice in the world.,1
excellent musicality pitch and range. Many pleasant memories associated with this time.,1
This is a clever catchy and funny song. I like the Tubes. They are a good group. I would like to hear more of their early stuff.,1
"I loved this song when I was a teenager, but never owed it.  I still love this song.  I was so glad to find it and make it mine.  It is one of my most favorite songs.  I recommend this to anyone who loves 60's music.  It is one of the most beautiful songs of that era.  I could listen to it every day for hours.",1
"Being over 60, I remember so many of these musical groups and I enjoy adding them to my IPod. Great song",1
"I first heard Mel carter and Hold Me , Thrill Me, kiss Me at a Hight school reunion in 1978 and can't leave alone for long as it's on every music device I have, Mp3 , CD's , etc.",1
"Mel Carter's voice is soft as silk and caressing as warm honey.  Like so many of my other purchases, I added this to my iPod oldies collection that I've been building.  The first time I heard this song I was 16 and in my first ""serious relationship"".  My boyfriend had a '57 Buick convertible and belonged to a car club, complete with a letterman's jacket and combed his hair in the Princeton style.  We'd sit at the park with the top down and listen to the radio, KJR coming out of Seattle.  It was a sweet time with Mel Carter's voice singing the words that made many a young heart soar.  Yet another great song that no baby boomer putting together an oldies collection should be without!",1
I would not have bought the song unless I first liked it. Download plays back good on my MP3 player.,1
"A great song from the 50s. i heard it on an Oldies station, so decided to get it and I'm glad I did.",1
"Some of our best singers are from the oler songs, and this one is no exception, beautiful, soulful, and relaxing!",1
"I heard this song from the Mel Gibson movie ""We Were Soldiers"" and then got the MP3 Mel Carter version on Amazon. Great song.",1
"I have very much enjoyed this song, since it was released and still enjoy it to this day. It describes me more today then it did the first time I heard it...I certainly appreciate this song more as an adult.",1
It sounds nice. I like the rhyme and lyric. For the money it sells it's a perfect piece of music.,1
This is a good product.  Filled the need for which i was searching.  I give it four stars as my rating.,1
I dare you!  One of those songs that your body just loves to bounce to.  Great in a happy funk mix.,1
Don't let the title scare you.  This is a song about all women and the many facets which represent our lives.,1
great - wish you could make your own samplers with individual songs - would be cheaper than buying individual songs  or buying an album for only one or two songs,1
"It's that angsty, we're not going to take any crap from men music that made the 90's so great. If you're not familiar with the song and it wasn't popular ""in your time"" then I'm not sure how you'll like it, but I already knew what I was in for... good times.",1
I had forgotten this song and heard it by accident on the radio and had to have it.  Highly recommended.,1
Who ELSE could write a song about a 14 year old who just happens to be Immaculately Pregnant and Still Tough Enough To Kick the Ass of Judas himself?,1
since buying cds are out of style and iTunes is always expensive I prefer to use amazon for music song is great and the preview is long enough for you to get an idea of the song,1
This song is by far the best work of A Fine Frenzy. It has amazing sound and touching lyrics you can relate to.,1
"This is a great CD and song. Everyone in the family loves listening, young to old. Great product, high quality and best part of all instant arrival.",1
One of the first country songs that got me interested in country music.,1

I HAVE ALWAYS LOVED THIS SONG AND THIS VIDEO. NOT MANY SONGS MAKE YOU FEEL 17 AGAIN. THIS SONG DOES. MOST OF US HAD A SUMMER CRUSH OR FIRST LOVE AND BY FALL IT WAS OVER. SO GLAD I COULD PURCHASE THIS TO ENJOY ON MY KINDLE.,1
"I absolutely love this song. I have the CD actually; purchased a looong time ago. For some reason I can't get it out of my head, so I decided to go ahead and download to my Kindle Fire. It's just a beautiful song. Did I say love it?? Love it (smile).",1
"this is another one of the few country songs that i actually do like. i am not sure where i had heard this song since i do not tune into or listen to much country but once i heard it, i just had to add it to my little collection of country music.",1
"Sweet song about innocence, first love and of course, strawberry wine.",1
"I was seventeen when I got married and I loved strawberry whine. Now it gives me a headache, I have four children and husband and a crazy hectic life, but sometimes like when I am listening to this song, I can relax and remember what it was to be young and love...",1
I remember this song most during the summers when we would be hanging out with my mom.  A great song that I now share with my kids.,1
I have loved this song since it came on the radio in the 80's and I am proud to now own it again. Thanks Amazon!,1
One-hit-wonder youth anthem.  I think we know what Katrina did... a klassic.  I'm kvelling!,1

This is back in the 80's totally. Nice and relaxing. I remember listening to this song on the radio almost everyday.,1
"Very energetic, up-beat tune. The song is more memorable than the movie it was in. I'll keep this on the playlist I call ""Energize Me"".",1
As a person who tries to stay positive this song is great for blocking all negative things that a day can throw at you :),1
This old song still has it..I learned the words as a teen because it was a defiant song and I still love them today. Suzie had a great.story telling voice.,1

"Every single person who lives in the USA SHOULD of wake up to this song And live up to it every minute,it would uplift the spirit of the country. Lee Greenwood's voice is simply the Best for this song",1
"I am a US Army veteran having served 8 years in Europe during the Cold War. This song speaks out of my heart. It should serve as a reminder to all of us as to who we are and what we should represent and what we value, such as our freedom which has cost it's price on several occasions throughout our history, starting in 1776. This is the album version from 1992. It is very good, even though a version released in 1990 has more appeal to some folks. It doesn't really matter that much. Any of Lee's versions of this wonderful song will bring the message across. That is what really matters, I think. The MP3 sound quality is as good as it can be.",1
Always loved this song. Realized I didn't have it on my computer so downloaded it.,1
"great song! Amazon knows how to impress its customers in terms of providing top songs such as this one. I like the ability to download this song as an MP3 and playing it on my own device, that is, if I purchased this song (which I did).",1
"This is one of my favorite patriotic songs. I have loved this song for years, since I was a kid.",1
Personal video. Had over 100 pics to go into the video. That's the reason for most of song purchases.,1
This is a great song! I downloaded it on the 4th of July. I have been playing it over and over! Lee Greenwood is a great artist. You won't be disappointed if you decide to buy it!!,1
"Is that a request for god to bless the U.S.A. ? I am curious as to what happened to all of the Native Americans, and why do european americans claim to ""own"" their house or own land anywhere in america?",1
"Of course, any proud American would but Lee Greenwood's voice is perfect for this beautiful tune.  I used it to make a video for my son's basic training graduation and it was a tear jerker..... Why?  Because of the song!",1
It reminds me of the fourth of July.l love the fireworks and they play this song when the fireworks go up.,1
"I originally heard it because of what happened on 9/11/01.  But since there were some more state and country incidents since 9/11, I believe it's a great song to bring people positively together to help others!!",1
I am very happy with this purchase and the product. I would even give this to friends and family who were interested in this type of product. .,1
I like this music very much and it was easy to download.  I am still listening to it.  great music,1
What can I say except it's Billy Idol at his best. The beginning of the song was played & sung exactly as the original song was. Then entered the remix which I found to be very entertaining. I would recommend this remix version.,1
"Years ago when this was a new song, a friend bought a 12 inch with this mix on it and I always wanted my own copy but couldn't find it. So here it was, right before me, I couldn't resist.  Classic Billy Idol with the great Steve Stevens on blazing guitar.",1
"This song tells how love can make you crazy. The way one person can make you feel unlike anyone else. I think this song put ""Heart"" on the map!!  The heart of ""Heart""",1
"Heck!  I'd buy it ten times over just for the guitar intro.  It's a tough call between that intro and the instrumental end of Clapton's Layla as to which one is my favorite.  Either way, good stuff!",1
"Not my favorite, but it was decent to listen to and a solid song.  I'll be looking forward to what they produce in the future.",1
"This song starts with drumming with a crisp rim shot punctuating a slowly writhing clavinet melody. This is soon joined by some deep piano chords. At one minute a wispy female vocal enters. The rim shot carries on throughout the tune with the occasional crackling, vinyl record sound entering from time to time. The rhythms are expertly intertwined to make a haunting and beautiful musical experience. I love this tune and consider it the best of Massive Attack (so far). What you hear on the sample is basically what you will hear on the download with the exception of the vocal. This is also used as the soundtrack for the TV show&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/House-M-D/dp/B002JVWR7M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">House, M.D</a>.",1
"Like Mazzy Star, Massive Attack is good at coming up with songs which are lengthy, melodic, mesmerizing, and very appropriate for ambient music for your home or for the backgrounds of films and TV.  In this case, this song ended up being played, without vocals, over the opening credits of the hit TV series House, MD.  It is a perfect choice for the dark-toned saga of an addicted doctor in chronic pain. Nice vocals and a heartbeat effect round out the song.",1
"Sounds just like a digital file of the actual song, which is exactly what it is.",1
