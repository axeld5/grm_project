"What the heck? Is this a tutu for nuns? I know you can cut it but STILL. Also there aren't several layers of the tutu making it ""poof out"" It just lays flat. Needless to say it was returned.",2
"I used this skirt for a Halloween costume and glued a bunch of feathers over it.  It was exactly what I needed.  I liked that the elastic waist didn't dig in (no muffin top).  Two things to note though:  (i) it is a little long; I cut about 8 inches off, but it was really easy to do; and (ii) it is see-thru b/c unlined - I had to get a pair of yellow shorts to wear underneath which I hadn't planned on doing.",2
"This is thick enough that you can't see through it, but it is very long, so be sure to check the dimensions. I ended up cutting it shorter.",2
"Already have an Atlas, topo CD set of Northeast, Garmin GPS Vista with topo/street maps.  Once I found these Gazetteers, I bought one for every state in New England and New York.  Each of the above provide different levels of information and alternative routes and access to various locations, often places with no direct road or trails.  The gazatteers provide fast detail access to areas in question over the GPS or atlas and are invaluable to me while in the vehical.  Although, the GPS is my lifeline away from the vehical, the gazatteers are large and not weather resistant.",2
"More of a road map than a useful topographical map.  I don't think it would be good for any kind of orienteering.  Nice quality, and tons of details, but its not much more than a road atlas.",2
Comprehensive atlas. Very happy with how much detail is in here.  I do wish there was a more detailed map of Syracuse so I could use it to navigate in the city.,2
Delorme has always made the best book maps in the USA.  Three thumbs up!,2
"If you're interested in exploring any area of New York beyond the metropolitan areas, this Delorme Atlas and Gazetteer is your best bet. Over the years I've collected these gazetteers for quite a few states, and they've come in handy when exploring out-of-the-way places, as I'm fond of doing. For me, this atlas proved most useful when driving around and hiking in the Adirondacks. I was able to find ways to get to some remote areas, thanks to the fact that the maps show secondary roads and backroads, and also show hiking trails. Because the maps are topographical, I have a pretty good idea in advance as to the sort of terrain I can expect to encounter, particularly in the hillier and mountainous territory. While I've used this mostly as a guide to the Adirondacks, it also appears that it would be quite useful in exploring other parts of the state because of the detail it shows.",2
"I try to hike in the Catskills 2-3 times each month. The iOS maps app is great for getting me to the proper GPS point for the trailheads. The trouble is the return trip: in the remote areas I hike, it's unlikely that I'll have data service when it comes time to head home. No data service = no navigation. Having a USA road atlas in the car is great for getting from state to state or city to city, but it does you no good on small country roads. The scale of this map, however, does let you see those smaller roads.  This is in my car and stays in my car. It's a beautifully rendered set of maps that map geeks will just love.  And now I can find my way home.",2
"Really, 4.5/5 stars. Missing a little detail when it comes to access roads and parking areas on state lands. Other than that, it's excellent.",2
"These are the best maps, I get one for any state I'm traveling in.  Need to pick one up for my Florida trip this winter!",2
"Sure anyone can use GPS but on a road trip with 91 year old Dad you can't exactly jeep hin involved with the trip with technology. I drove, he navigated using this atlas. Easy to use. Only wish there was a whole map of NY, not the one on the back used as index.",2
"Great product, FAST delivery! Just what we needed for RV travel!",2
Great map - we use it to select scenic and varying routes instead of relying on the one-size-fits-all routes that our gps chooses.  Especially handy when the gps signal goes kaput.,2
These are great for planning road trips especially trips that will take you off the major routes or out where cell reception and data plans don't work well. They have a lot of detail. I was recently out in the country on a little one lane dirt trail that amazingly enough was labeled as a road and was in this book. It was nice to be able to plan out a way to cut diagonally across the county to get where I needed to go instead of back tracking to a major route.,2
"These Gazetters are amazing! I own them for NY, VT, NH and ME. Fabulous! They provide info and details that go beyond what's available online and via smartphone apps.  I use these to find waterfalls and to learn about state parks and destinations. The extra info they provide about natural features/highlights are valuable too.  The only downside - they're big if you want to carry them around or keep them handy in your car.",2
"While perhaps not 100% accurate in extremely rural locations, nevertheless quite helpful and easy to read. I am buying a second copy to leave in the car when we go exploring.",2
"Arizona is a spectacular state.  There is so much to explore, from the Grand Canyon to old mining town of Bisbee.  North to south, east to west, this atlas will get you where you want to go.  Even in you have a GPS, it helps to have a broader visual back-up.  Get yourself an atlas and hit the road.  Happy Trails!",2
This is a must have for finding the tucked away backroads of Arizona....,2
"Excellent, as always. My 5th DeLorme atlas. If you want to boondock with a tent or small RV, these atlases are indispensable.  Joe",2
"Though being a used book, it looks to be brand new. Much better than advertised.",2
"I have a Delorme atlas for 11 US states. They're amazing; detailed, accurate, easy to read and aesthetically pleasing. The BLM land is easy to locate for free camping. Couldn't travel well without them!",2
"Absolutely essential for the ""back roads"" traveler.  One of the first things I do when planing a road trip to an unfamiliar area is purchase the map of the state.  I like & use GPS but there are times when it doesn't work AND it has been known to ""lie"".  In addition, GPS does not allow one to see the ""big picture"" like a map does.",2
I love to travel some of the really back roads and this series is very helpful.  I just wish they'd put date on the front so I could more easily tell new versions form older ones.,2
I have purchased other Gazeteer's for other states.  This one does not give the kind of information as does those from other states.  The off road routes are not in this gazette nor are the road numbers.  I was disappointed.,2
"I recently went on a long road trip to celebrate my retirement.  I would be driving thru at least 6 states and wanted to have a hard map on hand for planning purposes.  While I will have a Garmin GPS unit running, I do like having a manual backup - just in case.  I also like having a map so I can spend an hour the night before reviewing the route and perhaps looking for side roads to adventure.  The beauty of this retirement road trip is that if I see a road leading off into some unknown distant hills, I am free to go.  Trying to get a feel for the terrain ahead or where interesting waypoints along the way on a tiny GPS is impossible.  Having an actual map makes it so easy to look for alternate roads, forest service roads in the mountains, and possible stops.  Now that I'm home, my Atlas & Gazeteers are full of circles, scribbles, notes, and arrows.  They got a lot of use.  Even sitting at a rest stop, quite often other travelers would come up and ask me for directions to some place they're looking for.  The only downside to these maps?  Small print and I have old eyes.  I brought along a magnifying glass to read it better.  My bad luck to forget it at a rest stop and not realize it until I was 700+ miles away.  I stopped at a Walmart and bought another.",2
"The first Delorme atlas and gazetteer I ever purchased was years ago when my wife and I were planning a trip to the Keweenaw Peninsula (which juts out into Lake Superior from the U.P. of Michigan). Ever since I've made a practice of procuring a Delorme gazetteer before exploring a state. I find them most valuable for that purpose. And so, a few years back, when I knew we were going to be in the greater Phoenix area and were then heading to the Grand Canyon, I figured I would make sure I had an Arizona atlas so I could see more than just what I could observe from the major highways. With this Arizona gazetteer I discovered backroads that aren't found on a regular roadmap, hiking trails and trailheads, and other points of interest. Plus, because these are topographical maps, I knew in advance what sort of terrain we would be getting into before we headed into it. This was especially useful for when we were hiking.",2
"I purchased my first Delorme atlas and gazetteer several years ago when I was planning to spend time exploring parts of the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. I was so well pleased with the detail and how with its aid I was able to navigate the area that I decided to get one of these atlases whenever I was going to spend time in a state. So, when I headed to Arizona to combine a visit with my daughter in the Phoenix area with a trip to the area around the Grand Canyon I made sure I had a gazetteer with me. Like the others I have, this one proved invaluable. I was able to discover backroads that aren't shown on the typical roadmap. Plus, I was able to locate hiking trails and trailheads, thus allowing me to fulfill another passion while on my visit. I'm especially grateful that this is a topographical map, since it gives me a better idea of what sort of terrain I'll be encountering, whether I'm driving or on foot. I consider this to be an essential tool for serious exploration of an area.",2
"This is a very useful general purpose atlas for the entire state of Arizona.  I'm sure there are a few omissions, but, overall, it's about as complete as you can reasonably hope.",2
"I like the Arizona Atlas and Gazetteer because, like the other DeLorme travel guides, it is concise and easy to read, as well as easy to carry along with you on road trips. The maps are well detailed, providing the traveler with valuable information.",2
"This issue does not have San Tan Valley shown in it. My US road atlas shows it. FIx it, Delorme. A better job of keeping up with changes should have been done.",2
Have used the Delorme Gazetteers for years.  Needed this for Arizona as I plan to travel there.,2
"what can you say, its a map book. although I think the older version had more detail.",2
Good map books.  These are great for traveling and trip planning.  They show places of interests that you might not know about otherwise.  I have these atlases for several different states.,2
I have several of these they all have proven very accurate with many extras such as points of interest. Thanks,2
"I hunt and fish in Arizona, and I need a map that shows exactly where I'm at. It clearly show National Forest, BLM and State land. It even gives the GPS coordinates so if you're using a GPS, you can see exactly where you are at on the map. I've also got the Northern and Southern California as well as the Kansas Delorme maps for the same reason.",2
"if you travel the less beaten path, you will love this atlas, however I like the older version better, not sure why just yet , but something is different",2
I also have the have the New Mexico and Oklahoma versions. I think that the DeLorme atlases are more useful than the other atlases available.,2
"I use this with my adventure book all the time. Not as good as a topo, but close, and that is saying something.",2
"I go back and forth between Benchmark and DeLorme atlases.  The DeLorme versions feature larger scale, greater detail, more depiction of dirt roads and trails.  Benchmark has a more eye-friendly color scheme and layout, detailed maps for selected cities and land ownership maps (BLM, USFS, State, etc).  Somewhat frustrating as I end up with both for states I travel a lot in.  Benchmark, while not showing as many ""roads"" as DeLorme, it does a better job of indicating which of those side dirt roads are ""primary"".  Sometimes the DeLorme is TOO much detail.",2
"My wife and I have used these for years. I just wish they had them for other countries too. We've used the Michelin books and others, but they aren't as good because the scale is better. They are large books, but flat (18X12 inches). They wind up in my duffel bag as they can bend. I bought this one for a friend of mine coming to visit so he and his family could plan their vacation. It lists historic sites, natural scenes, camping places, etc. The maps show lighthouses which is really good as I photograph them and more importantly how to get there. They can be used with GPS though I am of the old school and have never found a real need for a GPS device. These map books and the human brain are adequate so far.",2
"Waste of money in my opinion.  Fails to show important mountains, ridges and other terrain.",2
I have already made great use of this Gazeteer!  I had an older version for over 15 years and it was too tattered to read anymore.  This new version has more information than the old one and I find it very useful.,2
"The DeLorme Arizona Atlas and Gazetteer is an excellent resource for trip planning.  Arizona is a deceptively big state with lots of wide open spaces and some specially rugged terrain, including the Grand Canyon.  This atlas should allow the average traveler to navigate pretty much anywhere on the road network, and to gain some appreciation for the terrain along the way.  The scale of the map is 1:260,000, which is reasonably useful for the size of the state.  Major roads are identified, and many minor roads are at least visible on the map.  The multicolored presentation enhances the terrain relief.  The map sheets are marked with latitude and longitude for GPS grids.  In addition to a locational gazatteer, this Delorme Atlas provides general information on recreational opportunities.  The listings include federal and state parks, game management areas for hunting, and locations suitable for fishing.  There is a handy listing of campgrounds and one map devoted to the Grand Canyon, a major visitor attraction.  The map scale is not suitable for off-road navigation.  Those travelers planning to do off-road route finding are advised to consult more detailed products.  The DeLorme Arizona Atlas and Gazetteer is very highly recommended for planning and navigating, whether for business or pleasure, around Arizona.",2
"Ok - I am new to the world of fly fishing - but, I have spent about $5,000 on equipment and trips already since June - this is a must in your vest or fanny pack on the water - helped me enjoy my time on the water and reduce frustration with remembering the knots - buy a nail knot tool before you do anything else...",2
This was part of a birthday gift/basket for my husband and he was thrilled to see this little pocket gem in the mix.,2
Purchased this as a part of a birthday gift for my husband who is newly into Fly fishing.  He was thrilled!,2
It has really helped me out in learning the art of flyfishing knots,2
What good product. Got one for my Granddaughter and one for myself,2
"fits in your vest pocket. waterproof too. well written, and grt illustrations,",2
"my husband knows just about everything about tying knots, but this makes a great stocking stuffer.  and perhaps there'll be something in it that he doesn't know!",2
"Excellently sized guide that fits vest pockets easily, and contains all the necessary knots in easily understood illustrations.  Pages are all coated to be water resistant if not water proof.  Definitely a handy purchase for those who are new to fly fishing or get a little rusty during the off season.",2
"Pocket Guides Guide to Fly Fishing Knots is a very well made little book .It's a great little book to put in your fisherman's vest, so when you need to tie a knot that you may have forgotten how, you just pull it out of your vest pocket and look up the knot of your choice. I love it for two reasons. One:The book is made of plastic so water won't affect it. Two:It's small enough to put in your vest while fishing, so if you need to refer it,it's right there with you. Great idea with great instructions.",2
It is set up for beginners and will be very helpful to them. It's not a bad reference for the more experienced fisherman either. I really liked the tab feature for quick reference.,2
This is a good overall book I would recommend for those individuals looking to understand disaster prepping and doing so on a restricted budget.,2
This book would be a good place to start planning for whatever level of prepping is appropriate for you. The admonition is to just start.,2
"MOst tips you can get from various and sundry internet sources, but it is a nice volume over all for the beginner prepper!",2
"This book is absolutely perfect for new preppers.  As a matter of fact, I think there's a lot of good information in it for experienced preppers too.  I have to admit that you can't beat the price either.  At only $2.99 I think it's a great value and I'm glad that I read it!",2
I have been building a library of resource books and this one fit well.  Somethings are easily handled at home and I like to have options.,2
"decent little book, i did enjoy but it didn't tell much more than i already knew, still it was entertaining!",2
Very Basic information on how and why to start preparing your family for an emergency.  The book is easy to read and for the beginner is a must have.,2
"An interesting read for me with some new advice for preppers.  I liked the advice about purchasing one extra while shopping so that one's budget doesn't get overpowered.  I had also never thought about a two way radio for communication.  And, last but not least, items are listed that would have a high value when used for bartering.  The author has also provided a list of websites that are helpful for an added bonus.  Most highly recommended.",2
this book tells alot about the coming mess in America and how to try to live through it. Enjoyed reading this book but needed more information.,2
"This is a great introductory guide to prepping. Very well written, well organized with good information and things to consider. It's basic though so it's one I would most recommend for people just starting out or considering what you might need to prepare for disasters. It doesn't go into great detail but covers all the bases for prepping - food storage, sanitation, defense, bugging in and bugging out, etc.  A really well done resource guide.",2
"Most of the information can be found on the internet for free. But if you are like me, it is easier paying someone for doing it for you. Most of the information is good advice. I found the reading to be a little boring at times. Had to force myself to continue reading through it. thank you",2
"This is an extremely basic beginner's guide to prepping. A very quick overview of the different aspects of prepping that need to be considered however with very little in depth coverage of any one subject. I would consider this to be more of an in depth checklist as opposed to an actual book. It took me about an hour to read the entire thing. Don't get me wrong, the subjects the author covers are important, especially for the newbie prepper, and it's a good motivational tool to get started. But this book really could be written by anyone who spent a few hours on the internet doing some research about prepping. I wouldn't spend more than about $5 for this book. The Kindle edition is worth the $2.99 but if you're looking to have a hard copy the $9.99 being asked is a bit steep I think.",2
"I am no expert and everyone needs a starting place.  If your looking for how many Lbs of beans to store per person, look elsewhere.",2
"Just the right size!  Will use just a small portion of attached stickers. (no kids here) Con: Maybe make ""stickers"" for the ""Retired ppl"" that buy this calendar?  ;o)  I'll be going to staples or the $ store for stickers. We live on the beach now, and needed a calendar reminder for when land-locked guests are coming for a mini beachy vaca. here. We can sleep 5 plus air-beds....so we need to know when to say no.  LOL",2
"Love this family calendar. We get one every year. Nice large spaces, stickers to enhance the calendar and lines to write on. With 5 kids and two adults this calendar has been the best one out there on the market for years. Even now with many kids off to college, we use this calendar for our busy family. We use the bottom line to write in the daily meal plan too! :)",2
I have been buying More Time Moms calendars for the past few years---this calendar is nice and large so I can fit all the activities of the day in each square :),2
I buy one of these every year.  Love the large boxes.  Love the stickers.,2
"I have been using this calendar for years, ever since I discovered it on the shelf at Borders (I now order it from Amazon).  My family runs by the ""If it isn't on the Calendar It doesn't exist"" rule.  Lots of room to write in each box for appointments, reminders, celebrations, etc.  About every other month is a color pic, but that is not a problem as my daughter loves to color in the months not color printed and it makes the calendar even better.  I think, I would actually be sad if they had full color and I couldn't have her ""fix"" it for me as she has been doing this for years!",2
"This toy/sled is the biggest piece of garbage! It has been hyped on U-tube and it's really not worth a crap for anything! To start with I'm a father of 2 active and sports oriented kids, a son who's 10 and a daughter who's 9. To get an idea of our outside activities we ski, snowboard and go sledding every year and both children play hockey, baseball and basketball and we live in a middle class suburb of Chicago. This year we went to upper MI were my kids and their friends stay outside for hours going down hills on saucer sleds (which from our testing of all the other sleds are the absolute best). All of the 6 kids with us, ages 7-10, tried these for about 2 minutes and said they suck! The spooner's would go about 4 feet and then just stop and the kids said they tilted to the side and they couldn't stay on. As for using these during the summer if you've got a bike, basketball court, baseball field or a park field around you why waste any time tooling around on this thing? In the summer my son and daughter ride a ripstick waveboard and skateboards and these are infinitely more fun than this spooner piece of crap. As a final note what a piece of garbage this thing is: Since Christmas when my kids and their friends got these they have been sitting in a pile outside my garage and have not been touched once, the kids have absolutely no interest in these.",2
"I bought this for my 4 yr old daughter to help her develop a better sense of balance. She loves to stand on it while playing wii games. I feel less guilty when she's getting screen time, b/c her balance is improving and she's getting a core workout as well. I'm not much of a skater, so I didn't get much out of this item on dry land. However, this thing is awesome on the snow. The poor-man's snowboard. I suggest getting the larger version as it will come in handy on the slopes.",2
kids and friends (boys and girls) from 4 years to 13 years love these!!!! I don't mind them doing tricks in the house and it keeps their bodies moving. I didn't realize you can do so many tricks... they are a bit pricy so I was hesitant. but worth every dollar! great idea and very pleased,2
Got these for our five grandchildren ages 6 to 10. The boards are a good size for the kids. They provide a nice activity for the kids inside during the winter months. Boards are very sturdy. The kids are learning new tricks all the time. Haven't tried them as sleds yet.,2
"We purchased this for our 5 year old son - he loves it and plays on this all the time on cold/rainy days. HE has no use for it outdoors or when the weather is better - he prefers the skateboard. Older kids seemed amused with the board, but for shorter periods of time - 5 minutes here and there. The board is clearly not for everyone, but I have found playing a youtube video with some trick ideas helps spur more activity. It's also a good way to practice balance for young ones.",2
"Our Grandsons, seven and nine seemed very pleased with these boards. I liked that they can use them indoors and out, and they will be able to improve balance and coordination.with these.",2
"At any given time we can have from one to five grandkids at our apartment. It's a smaller apartment and outside play space is at a premium. We have this Board and it has turned out to be a fun tool for burning off some excess energy and having a few laughs.  The thing is light and easy to store, but it's practically indestructible.  Little guys can, at the very least, sit on it while you spin them around. The older kids can actually do the flip-it-up and land on it tricks. The friction tape on the top holds feet securely and the smooth bottom is fine on our commercial carpet. Adults can always do the twist on it, which I guess counts as a core workout and certainly cracks up the grandkids.  A nice find and a handy active toy.",2
"Made well, solid constructions, works as advertised.  However, although it does ""fit most doorways 24"" to 32"" wide"" (as advertised),  if you have an old house with narrow doors (mine are 29"" wide), the half circular hand grips' end pieces project  past the main horizontal bar, which causes them to rest on the door frame and create dents. This is easily prevented by putting something in between.  Doors over 30"" won't have this problem.",2
"This would have been a great product, but the sides of the pull up bar that press against your door frame are not padded, so when you use it, they dig and rub against your door frames and quickly grind off the paint. Unless you don't have paint on your frames, or pad the ends somehow, I would pass on this and get a different one.",2
"I'm not really any good at pull ups or chin ups, but this is a decent item for a beginner, if paired with a stool or chair. Most of the grips are comfortable, and the only ""sturdiness"" concerns I have are that my doorjamb is strong enough to hold me up. Only complaint is that the grip cushions on the upturned grip slide down when held, but it's not a deal breaker to me. Works great with P90X!",2
"lousy materials, tubes came bent. so poorly designed that it literally made a hole through one of the walls next to the door. dangerous to use. should i continue? i bought it on sale and would probably pay more by returning it. another piece of cr to the garage. ps i literally chewed one of the screws away just by tightenign it now it will never be unassambled..",2
"This product is horrible.  I am 5'8 and weigh 160 lbs, and it wobbles when I try to do a pull up.  It doesn't grip the door properly, and just feels unstable and unsafe.  i do not recommend this product.  I went to walmart and got a pull up bar that was cheaper, and so much more stable.",2
"I was unimpressed by this product.  It arrived in a box that was already splitting open, so I worried that I did not receive all of the pieces.  Luckily I did, but I could not put the thing together.  The screws seemed too big for the nuts they were supposed to go into and too long overall for the bar itself.  Had I been able to put this product together I would have had extra long screws poking out of each hole.  The one good thing about this product was even though I went past my 30 day return window - the company still OK'd my return.  Too bad the shipping cost was almost as much as the product itself.  I have yet to see the refund, but I would assume it takes about a week or two to process.",2
This is a sturdy product that fits well in the doorway and can handle my 170 lb. weight.  It was easy to put together.,2
"I started the P90X program by using resistance bands but after a bit, felt I needed to really go the true Pull Up route instead.  After looking around Amazon, it made the most sense for me to go with the BMP bar.  I had previously purchased the BMP resistance bands and I'm happy with those so far.  Well, the package arrive (yay Prime) and I quickly assembled it.  Make certain that you tighten the locking nuts really well.  I didn't use the optional but included black ""L"" brackets and placed it right on the door frame to see how it felt.  It feels very solid and is in no way going to hurt the door, moulding, or surrounding wall.  I'm using a fire door from my laundry room to my garage.  The nice thing is that my garage steps down 6-8 inches so as I place the bar facing the garage, I get that additional height to work with.  Goes up and comes down in < 10 seconds.",2
These bands are high quality and very easy to use. My one issue is the side straps at the handles tend to rub the sides of your hands with certain moves. I still would recommend purchase at this low price.,2
This is a great addition to your work out and is very easy to use and adapt into your workout. My only issue with it is some moves make the sides rub your hands which repeatidly don't feel so hot. I actually use this instead of weights and it does the job!,2
"Instructions are weak. I built and re-built three times before I got the order right. Make sure you connect the L bracket to the U handles before you screw them into the long bar.  Otherwise, it works well.  The product literally stinks when you open the box. I got a nice whiff of VOCs. Yay chinese made products!  I would probably buy again though.",2
"Great price and a great product, works well and have not had any issues with product wear with consistent use. I have been using this multiple times a week over the last 6 months and it hasn't failed me yet!",2
Have enjoyed these resistance bands but after ~<1yr of use both the orange and purple have broken. Not sure what expected shelf life is on product.,2
"Good quality, acceptable price. I only  have a little concern about connection of the handles, seems not that much strong, but so far works well.",2
might upgrade to the heavier one purple just isn't cutting it. very very high quality and make,2
"Black Mountain resistance bands are great. I purchased several of them and have been using them for over a year now, but I'm suspicious about the quality of the rubber. They seem not stretch as much as before and some have torn easily.",2
"I liked it at first but I'm already on my second one. I have the green one (10-12 lb.). I use it 3-4 times a week for no more than 10-30 minutes each time. I use it with my exercise video that requires one. The first one broke after 8 months of use and the second one is already splitting in places and looks like it will break any day now. I've only used it for 4 months. I will have to try a different brand because it should really last longer than that when used properly, as I do. It hurt when the first one broke. It snapped during use and smacked me on the leg. (Imagine a VERY large rubber band snapping you from fully stretched) So, needless to say...I don't want to experience that again.  As a side note...I never did find a need for the door anchor that comes with it.",2
Great band for the price. The door attachment works wonderful too!,2
It works fine for my use. I often mount it in a doorway and it doesn't slide or anything.,2
I have used almost every day for the last 6 months and still working great. I do three sets from about 5 or 6 workouts shown in the guide. I feel a big improvement in strength and am glad I don't have to go to a gym. I bought one for about the same price at Dollar General that lasted all of two weeks before snapping. Highly recommend!,2
"Love this resistance band! It's exactly how it's described, I ordered the Strong one and it's exactly what I was looking for. Will definitely order other strengths of this band in the future.",2
Great exercise band.  Seems sturdy and well made.  Door anchor and user guide are great suppliments for this product!,2
"They stretch out and loose some of their strength with daily use over time but I still give them a top rating. For the money, I think it's a good buy.",2
I bought this green one and ended up buying the blue one too for less resistance.  You don't realize how tight 10 pounds can be until you try to do arms.  Make sure you check the color guide before purchasing!,2
"I mainly use this band, as well as a couple from the Black Mountain band set, for traveling. It's great being able to get a full body workout wherever you go! They go with me anywhere I go, whether that's here in the US or abroad.",2
"Work great.  Really help me in the morning when i am stretching.  Never used one of these before, but i am glad i bought it!",2
"Half the price of the other brand I replaced it with, and the quality seems equal.  In fact, possibly better, as I like the padded handles.  Also, they come with an attachment for securing them in a door jamb.  I will look for this manufacturer the next time I need one.",2
It a bit shorter than I like but it will do.,2
"I'm doing some upper body rebuilding after an injury and thought I'd try the Black Mountain Bands. I find them a great alternative to free weights and something I can pack easily when traveling. The door anchor that is included can be used both in a door stop or you can slip a dowel through the loop to stand on or to use under a door for a different pulling angle. I have two bands now and intend to purchase more as my resistance needs grow. Also, you can actually double up the bands as the pull handles are padded enough to hold two in your hands (I wear medium sized gloves, so smaller hands might have trouble with this). Also Black Mountain makes a set with removable/swappable handles to make multiple-banding easier.",2
"This resistance band is very nice , provides exactly what I need to get an extra burn in my workouts. Can be used for biceps , resistance running and all other exercise.  I chose the purple band , beats all other prices at retail stores and worth the price. It is very durable , it hasn't stretched out ... Yet.  I recommend this product.",2
Love this!!!  I secure the band on my sturdy Elliptical and it works perfect!  Feels strong and resistance is perfect for me.,2
My back is rippling with muscles in large part to this helping me during p90x & hammer & chisel type workouts.,2
"I just started using resistance bands and this blue one (4-6 pounds) seems perfect for me. I use it with Julian Michaels 90 day revolution, Month 1, and love the band and the workouts. Will move up to the black band next month as the resistance bands have weight associated with them.",2
slightly weak then what i expected from a blue coded band but each manufacturer has different strengths. still adequate.,2
"I bought this for my husband, first one snap by the handle almost injuring him. when I contact seller they send the replacement right away (great service). Unfortunately replacement broke too exact same way. I could not return it since it passed 30 day period. I would not buy this product or recommend it to anyone.",2
"I love this product. The door mount makes it so that your diversify your workout. I have been lifting weights for a long time, so the 25 lb resistance doesn't hit my body hard enough, so I ended buying another band to gain a little more resistance. I can definitely get a good sweat going with them.  These days, I only hit the gym about twice a week to hit deadlift, squat and bench. On most other days, I do circuit training with these and they are awesome. Great for travel as well.",2
Perfect for monster walks to keep your hips and knees healthy as well as building lateral acceleration.,2
I got this for my girlfriend because she wanted to do resistance training but was bot comfortable with weights. So far she loves it. The bad provides adequate resistance with lots of flexibility for exercises that can be performed. Tested it myself and it actually feels like a 15lb band comparable to weights over the course of a full workout. They have been used for over a month now and so far they show no signs of damage and stretch quite far.,2
You can do so much with this resistance band! Such a awesome workout!,2
"Good simple resistance band kit, works well.  Close in any sturdy latching door and you are good to go.  Comes with useful instructions and suggestions.",2
Love this. I use it to give me support when doing squats.,2
"I bought this to get back into working out.  I was struggling to find time getting to the gym and I didn't see a point in investing in an elaborate work out machine or getting multiple weights to lift with.  After doing some research I decided to try this out.  First off, I like that it is light weight. I have taken this on one trip so far and it fit super easily in my luggage without any extra weight.  Second I liked how versatile this band is especially with the door weight.  So basically, the product comes with an attachable door anchor which allows you to be able to do a variety of work outs such as pec flies or rotator cuff exercises.  I found that the anchor was sturdy and I didn't have much trouble with it.  The band itself has seemed pretty sturdy along with the handles.  I've gotten some good use out of this band and have had no troubles with it.  I feel that I can get in a decent work out when I can't make it to the gym.",2
"I purchased the orange resistance band, and am satisfied with my purchase. I am a 19 year old male, about 5' 10"", 155 lbs. The orange resistance band is a great band for male starters, I believe. After a couple days using the band, however, I believe that I could have used a band one or two resistance weights higher. If you consider yourself a stronger male, I would go perhaps one weight above the orange band.  As for the band itself, it is very handy. It is portable, so you can take your workout anywhere. I have had no structural problems with the band, as it looks well made. The band comes with an instructional booklet, so you can test out different exercises. I love using the band, because you can get the same workout as a weight bench from just a single resistance band. The attachment for the door is also handy, allowing you to do pull downs, rows, presses, and even squats. After a couple weeks of use, the band shows no signs of wear, despite stretching it to full capacity.  Note: if you are looking for simple stretching for sports warm-ups, you may want to take a look at a lighter band.",2
The band serve it's purpose. The description of the tension was on point.,2
"I bought this about a week ago and when I first received it I was exactly what I wanted. It provided the necessary resistance. However, after a few days of using it (I think I used it like 3-4 times), there was hardly any resistance. I wish I could get my money back.",2
"This resistance band works great, I do wish I had gotten a higher weight.",2
"It lasted about a year, using it for a couple of exercises 2-3 times a week.  It completely snapped in half this past week.  I'm not sure if I will purchase this brand again as a replacement or try a different one.",2
Great resistance band! Feels well made and has been used often since I received them.,2
works fine for me.  I am out of shape and not strong,2
"I wish I got a heavier poundage, but I really think this is a great quality band.",2
Love resistant bands and the amount of exercises you can do with them! High quality rubber band that has lasted several months of garage gym use with no fraying or signs of deteriorating . This band is high quality and the handles are very comfortable. Would recommend the Black Mountain Products and wouldn't have any issue going back and purchasing more!,2
"Excellent quality band, I use it every upperbody workout everytime for my flat bench I love it!",2
I am a teacher and I use these bands for an after school fitness club for middle school students. They are very durable and the students love them. The only problem I have with them is the material that connects the handle to the band is rough on the edges. After about a half an hour of use your thumbs can get pretty irritated by the friction if you do not keep adjusting the grip.,2
Needed a stronger band than what I had previously. This works great!,2
"A little short for me (5'11""), but other than that works great.",2
Works very well. The door anchor increases the versatility of the product significantly and I use it several times a week. I will buy one with more resistance a well as since I'm apparently stronger than I first anticipated.,2
I like it but I wish it was a little longer for some of the exercises that I do.,2
"Nice resistance band, the handles are really nice on it. Pretty heavy resistance which is good.",2
"Great Product, exactly what I expected. Great value for the price.",2
Very nice band I love the weight and the soft handles that don't hurt my hands. Really there's not much more to say about this product it does what it's supposed to with good durability and comes with a door anchor so you can't go wrong there.,2
works great feels good in my hands will recommend to anyone,2
"For anyone serious about working out, just get actual weight sets. These are virtually useless and don't do much in improving one's strength.",2
"I started with the light resistances band. After being well satisfied with that  band, I decided to try a the this band. I loved it from right out of the box. Keep up the great work Black Mountain. :).",2
"I bought a full set and a single a couple of years ago and just recently unfortunately broke two of them. I contacted the company for a hassle-free replacement, and could not be happier.",2
"great exercise band.  super easy to use, good amount of resistance and great for a work out anywhere.  if you had the excuse of not having enough space or time to work out then you can't make any excuses with this band.  it has a good amount of resistance for both males and females.  don't expect this to build up huge muscles though. this is for those that want a toned body (arms) and are ok with using resistance as a mean of doing so.  personally i like the toned look than the bulk so this is perfect for me.  i can put this in my luggage so i can carry it when i travel and work out in the hotel.  theres enough amount of exercises you can do with it so you can work out several body parts with a flick of the wrist.  the product itself seems durable and of good quality.",2
Great product and fast shipping. Already used and love the excerises it comes with. I highly reccomend this product .,2
This product is a fantastic way to get in shape. I have used it for a few days now and it is absolutely perfect. The product comes with a small booklet that lets you know about the many different types of exercises that can be done. I also used this resistance band with a few of the kids I train at soccer practice and they love it. The resistance band has one small stretch mark but other than that no sign of wear and tear. The black resistance band is definitely for people ages 14 and up.,2
"I doesn't feel like quite 25 lbs, but it doesn't matter because you can always shorten the length that you're using. It dseems very durable and has comfortable handles.  The door attachment is very easy to use, as long as you can reach the top of the door.",2
I like the quality of the handles. The stretch is good. The only thing I would prefer if it were a little longer.,2
I've never avidly used resistance bands until now and I'm happy that these were my first bands. They are very well made and come with a handy door anchor and booklet with exercises. I chose the Green (medium) bands equal to lifting about 10-15 lbs. Handles are well cushioned and the band itself is strong enough that I am confident that it will be a long time before it starts to wear out. Great price too! Highly recommend!,2
"I've used Black Mountain resistance bands before and I like them. The company is also great -- previously, I had an issue with the foam handles on a band arriving damaged, and they replaced it cheerfully and quickly. This band came in good condition, no issues. The only thing I would mention is that you have to have a door in your house that has some clearance on either side, so you can insert the door anchor and have room to do the exercises. I have sixteen doors in my house and only one works for this purpose. It's in my office, so at least I'm reminded to get up every once in a while and exercise! I do find that the band is too short to do some exercises. Or maybe I just can't pull hard enough on it!",2
"I have the starter set, with five bands, door hanger and ankle cuff already, and thought this would be a nice addition. It is the next toughest up in level (35-40lbs). Oddly, the instructions included only list the resistances for the first five I already had, and I only knew what this resistance was from enlarging the photo on the Amazon product page. I dinged it one star, because unlike the rest of my set, the cables on these are not clipped, but run through the grips, so in order to double up resistance, I will have to hold two grips in each hand, and can't use this strength with the cuff The door hanger strap is included, though.",2
"I started a club with band strength training and I have been building up a home/travel collection of bands to use and I really like the Black Mountain bands they have a slightly different feel to their handles but the quality matches what they have in the gymn and the other, apparently no name bands that I received as a gift.  I will be looking to fill in more of the bands as budget allows, and I think I'm going to go with a set of the fixed Black Mountain bands as they appear to be fairly decent quality.  As for a workout, if you are thinking about using bands, they are effective and all your truly need to get toned.  I use them in the gymn setting and the workouts go by fast, can easily be increased to make sure you are reaching muscle failure and are flexible for all major muscle groups. I'm a workout novice, but love using them and I've had striking results in just months.",2
"What can a reviewer say about a piece of rubber cord?  Never having used an exercise band before, I went into this experience completely cold, so I offer my observations as a rank novice.  This band seems very well made. The handles attach to the band through sturdy metal grommets that look like they'll never come loose. Black rubber sleeves over the joints add a finished look. Clad in thin sponge rubber over plastic cores, the grips are thick enough to grasp easily, and the textured rubber provides for a firm grip even with sweaty hands. The straps that attach the grips to the band have no loose stitching or sharp edges, and the sewing is tight. On the down side, the band exudes a strong, unpleasant chemical odor, but I'm sure that'll go away after a short time here in the dry Southwestern desert air.  Overall, this band, along with the included door anchor, appears to be a high-quality product.  The ""Exercise & User Guide"" that comes in the package explains how to use the band, and of course it includes the obligatory cautions, warnings and legal disclaimers (""Always use safety glasses...""). The step-by-step instructions feature small but useful black-and-white photos of each exercise. You can find many more exercises, including the lower-body ones that I was particularly interested in but that are not in the User Guide, on the Black Mountain Products website.  This Black Mountain Products band adds a new option to my exercise regimen, and I expect it to see a lot of use. Based on this sample, I'm very satisfied with the brand and the product.",2
"This product is a resistance band with the one I tested being the lowest resistance available.  The band itself it hemmed in permanently with fabric handles which are pretty generous in terms of being an easy grip.  The band itself itself was fairly low resistance but is still useful for many exercises including curls and leg exercises.  I suppose the only downside of this band it the inability to be able to change or add resistance.  Therefore, you will need a few different bands for differing exercises and uses.  The band included a door attachment, but frankly, with mos interior doors, it is far too easy to rip the door frame apart using it (or any other similar item).  Otherwise,  this is a well made item and I have found this and other bands are great for many uses in the home and also for travel (where taking this is great for stretching) because this can be packed easily.",2
"These have been the only bands I've ever bought. With that in mind, they meet my expectations but wish they'ed last a little longer. My most used band developed nicks after about 18 months. After tempting fate I decided to heed the manufacturers warning and get a new one. They come in any weight range you can imagine. I initially bought a pack of 5 or 6 but since replaced and bought individuals. I don't have the space for weights and I understand they'll never be the same but I love the portability and flexibility to do just about any weight lifting exercise.",2
"This was great until.... SNAP! on the 4 use. Maybe it was the surface I wrapped it around, but my cheap $2 grey band that's lower rated hasn't ripped after 50+ uses.  Going back and getting the next step up",2
There well made and have not broken on me yet. I have gotten used to them and need more tension. I will buy this product again as my fear of breaking on my face or other  has gone away.,2
I bought it for my office to help out between workouts when I get bogged down.,2
"The Black Mountain band is an adequate medium quality band.  At its price point it is a fair deal.  Better quality bands have higher quality handles which switch from band to band.  With the black mountain set, you have to buy each band separately.  For most people one band will probably be ok, but knowing which band to pick might be difficult for a beginner.  You can adjust the tension by stepping back from the door another space, of course.  Overall I think this is a decent product.  I've used better quality.  I wish I could comment on long term reliability but that will have to wait for an update.",2
"This set of resistance bands are strong, well made and solid.  I've only used them for a few days but the quality appears to be there to this point.  The accompanying booklet  provides 18 different exercises, some using a door to secure the bands and others that can be done by standing on them.  An anchor is provided that allows the bands to be secured to a closed door although it does not seem to work on all doors (depends on clearance available and how tight the door is to the frame).  However, the anchor is secure and solid.  A full set of bands are available with difference strength levels though I only tested the ""extra heavy"" red set.  For a beginner, probably a progression of strengths will be more effective and allow for a better workout while learning the exercises.",2
"Bands are good for portability, and I like doing some exercises with them at home because they prevent ""cheating"" in the same way rings do and allow for some unique exercises.  I've tried a few brands, and the Black Mountain ones are pretty typical.  I have the red one, which is still fairly thin.  This type of band has the handles attached rather than clipped on, so bands can't be combined.  If you are okay with that, I think you'll be happy with these.  The handle is comfortable and they work well.",2
"As always, great product and a great purchasing experience, fantastic on both accounts !",2
"Tough band, but it you want to get the best out of a workout, you gotta put in the work. It does accommodate for easier tension, but its also brutal for the heavy workouts.",2
Not that it matters but I haven't used it much and the black tubing is already losing its color,2
"One of the main reasons why I ordered this product was because it was elligible for Amazon Prime and it had good reviews. When the product was delivered it came in a small rectangle box and inside the box was the resistance band and the door anchor with a note from the company as well as a mini instruction book. I usually buy products from sellers who have a good customer service reputation and I read from several reviews that this company had good service so that was another reason why I bought this product. Anyways, I bought this product so I could use it for shoulder workouts, they provided a small book with workouts that you could do. I've been using the resistance band for a day and you could easily tell that these bands are made with good material and are not cheap :). I am a 5'6 female and I weigh 120 lb. so I don't really have any problems with it going too far or being too long for me to use but I thought the door anchor could have been made with a better material. That didn't really matter to me because it is still effective, though I am planning on buying a separate door anchor just to be safe! Overall this product is good and I am planning on updating this review after a month of use.",2
I own several of these and keep them in my weight room and also at my second home and travel pack. They work well and are a great value. They allowed me to rehab two shoulders.,2
Great quality and a strong band!  I will probably buy more,2
"I worked out once back in '08. I picked up some 40 lb weights and was like - ""too easy"". So then I grabbed some resistance bands and almost broke them. Now I've been recommended Black Mountain products because they are very durable. I've had a set of the 25 lb red resistance bands for 3 months now and they look as good as when I first got them after an hour of use every day except Sunday.",2
"I love these bands, they are versatile In the many different ways you can use them, great for upper arm strength as well as for your legs, made of good quality, I use them all the time and it shows.",2
"I bought the bands becasue I needed something with heavier resistance for p90X, assuming that the band would be the same length as the other bands I've used, but this band was way shorter....too short in my opinion.",2
"So it worked well for a couple weeks, but during a lunge workout, it snapped on me.  I liked it and thought it was a great product until this happened.  I noticed small rips on the band.  This could have been the issue.",2
I bought this product it the hopes of using it along with various video's and have not had a need for it.  This is why I only gave it a 3 cause I have not had a chance to try it out.,2
"Great compliment for my T25 work out.  A little more resistance, and comes with a nice door mount feature. Purchased this for me, as my wife is using the T25 included set.",2
"My girlfriend is disabled and cant do high impact workouts. This band is great because she can go at her own pace, in any position and any retention she needs. A lifesaver for low impact needs.",2
"I bought the purple one to add to my Strong Man Set of 6 to make it a Super Strong Man Set of 7. This is one tough band. Great for high intensity bicep curls and door anchor exercises, such as back rows and standing chest press. But too difficult for tricep kick backs. It came with a door anchor and an instruction pamphlet. There's no BMP logo on either handle just like their orange band. Overall I'm glad Black Mountain is going the direction of making their systems better and stronger. Keep up the good work.",2
Well I have had this band for about a month and its as good as when I got it so yeah I will be ordering another if this one snaps.,2
"This was my first purchase and use of resistance bands.  I have limited mobility due to my health, weight and age and my doctor recommended I try these for low impact exercising to start with.  I have been able to find a number of workout routines online even some I can do sitting in a sturdy chair.  With diet and the use of these bands for at least 30 minutes a day I have already lost 10 pounds.  I am sure my doctor will be as happy as I am.",2
"I previously had purchased a much cheaper band and it was not good quality. This was still incredibly affordable but it is good quality. The handles are comfortable, the band has exactly the resistance I would expect and having used it several times now I am tempted to go back and buy the multi set they sell. I haven't used the door hook at all, but it seems good quality as well. I definitely recommend this band, if anything I would recommend just getting the multi pack right away.",2
"Very good resistance band.  I would definitely buy others of the same brand. Would have been nice to have a sheet with recommended exercises, but it is pretty easy to figure out.",2
Great for my older students to use in fitness stations.  Kids love them.  I will definitely get more and recommend them to other teachers.,2
"Haven't had the chance to fully use this yet, but after inspection and testing, it seems in good shape and appears it will hold up. I'm already waist deep in my workout program, so it wil be used shortly.",2
"I have had 3 sets of resistance bands made by others, and the ones I have from BMP are simply the best by far. They are stronger, more durable and, most importantly, so much smoother is use. When I first got them (this one is just the strongest one that did not come with the 5 band set I bought last year), I noticed that they were shorter than any others I had used and was quite concerned. But, once I used them, I found the range of motion was the same and the smoothness of the motion was so superior that I can feel I am getting a much better workout.",2
"This is a great product! Is highly durable, easy to use and just an all around great band (much higher quality than the products i have bought at some chain sporting good stores). The only reason i gave it a four star rating is because after i bought this product, i actually ended up having to buy the adjustable set because i needed to have something a little more diverse for my p90x regimen. But thats more of my fault than the products falt, lol.  Update: Today, one of the two bands i bought, had a huge rip in it (it has been a little over two months since i started using) its not as durable as i thought it was when i started with them. I emailed BMP about the product warranty. They responded in under a day, i told them about my situation and they decided they would send me two ORANGE BANDS UPON MY REQUEST (one for my set where the handles detach and one normal one, orange is the heaviest band they have and isn't available on amazon). Excellent customer service!",2
Good for the price and very functional and easy to use. They do tend to rub the side of your hands with certain moves but still I would make this purchase knowing that fact.,2
"Nicely complete set.  I use it for travel where I don't know what to expect at a hotel fitness center.  It seems like a pain to have so many options and one set of handles, but it isn't too bad.  It also makes it easy to combine them if needed.",2
I have only had these for a few Months. I have only used them a handful of times and the blue one snapped on me this morning during my workout. Seems like they should last longer than that especially since Ive barely used them.  Update: I contacted the company directly because my return window through amazon had closed. I told them my blue band had snapped after not very many uses. They immediately sent me a brand new blue band! Great customer service.,2
"Bought these bands which are of a great quality.  Once received, there was an offer inside to call the number to get a stronger band for free.  Just called the telephone number is received it within 4 days.  Can't beat that.",2
"Love the set, I really should be using it more though!",2
"Nothing bad to say, I got the product fast and its held up for over a year now, Im very happy!",2
"Okay.  So I have had these resistance bands for little over a month now and am really pleased with them.  The main thing I like about them is that they are so easy to configure due to the carabiner connectors.  While I am not a materials engineer the quality of the bands and the various components is good.  The stitching on the ankle and door bits is good.  I had no problem using the door attachment.  It slid right into the space between the door and frame.  I closed the door and was working out within minutes, once I got the right level of resistance I was looking for.  Need more just add another band.  Need to reduce the resistance just swap out or reduce the number of bands you have attached.  Easy as pie.  I do recommend paying attention to the warning about wearing protective glasses for your eyes.  I have had no slippages but always play it safe when it comes to my eyes.  I use my DeWalt goggles that I bought for using with power tools.",2
"These are great! I like that they have the over the door attachment too, good for workouts",2
I received this as a gift for Christmas and am thrilled! The door set-up is extremely easy and it holds in the frame well. The instructions for use are simple and easy to follow also. I asked for these to take my workouts on the road and they have done just that. Highly recommended for any athletic traveler.,2
These have been great. Be sure to use in a sturdy door and frame.,2
Worked about what you would expect. No complaints. I used them while doing P90X until my dumbbell collection was built up.,2
"These bands have been perfect for my Cross fit style workouts.  The bag makes it easy to transport and use in a gymnasium, track or field.  I also really like having the weight (colored band) options.  I think it's rare to have so many weight options for the cost of the set...super affordable!  The clips that attach to the handles make it extremely easy to change out too.  I very happy with the fast shipping.  I did call  Black Mountain to ask about  their sleeves to cover the bands, which were not in stock and on order.  The company was easy to reach and I talked to a real person...who provided solid information!  Great product, solid company!",2
"Resistance bands training DOES WORK folks, look at the results I'm getting... If I CAN DO IT, so CAN YOU... Make 2018 the year you look good... Wishing everyone the best, let me keep you motivated!",2
You cannot beat the price on this product. Most of the competitors wants about 25 to 45 dollars for what it offers. It has the metal clips/hooks instead of the plastic hooks. It works well.,2
fast shipping ordered Tuesday got them Thursday. well made not cheap like some. for the price i'm surprised i am the first person to review come on you get one for fifteen here five no brainer good tension definitely recommend.,2
My son is 14 years old and fit very nice in him. It is very cute. Estaba bien hecha. Vale la pena,2
Colors is amazing same as he's uniform. He did play pretty good went he wear it.. He's so happy with it,2
"Great looking necklace. In 5'9"" 140lbs average sized guy and this necklace fits nice. Sits about a inch and half from my neck which is great for a ""sports"" necklace in my opinion. I didn't get it for its ""healing"" effects, but I do feel alittle better.",2
Nicest and most versatile band system I've seen in over 10 years. My only suggestion would be to increase the thickness of material under the foam in the handles. I fear repeated use at the combined higher multiple band tensions will cause the handles to deteriorate. Otherwise a well conceived product!,2
"It is a basic titanium necklace. My son doesn't wear it too much, too bad it didn't come in just black and orange without the white strands.",2
"I ordered 2 necklaces for my sons for one of their baseball team colors... once they started wearing them, I ended up placing an order for our entire team and coaches!",2
Our son wears this almost every day.  The clasp was a bit tough to undo at first but it has gotten a bit easier over time for him to maneuver. Appears to be very good quality too and the price was great!,2
"I had no problem with them, unless your really weak you won't need to use the other bands unless your adding weight to them. I use the red and black most of the time.",2
"very flexible, you can do a lot of exercise with these!",2
great for use in all the rehap exercises or the smaller muscle groups...i would get them again..,2
Great bands for my cross-training. I don't like to lift at the gym because of the douchebags so this is great to be able to do it at my own time at my house.,2
They won't replace weights but if you're recovering from an injury or just looking for something more travel friendly these will do the trick for a good price. They quality is better than expected.,2
Used these on deployment when we were at outposts that didn't have gym equipment. Works great and has plenty of weight for a hasty work out. Would be good for the hike or office as well.,2
Just received these and tried them out tonight. Happy with purchase and will start out slow and work up.  Will let you all know how things progress. I know these are not for major muscle building but keeping toned up.  Will do business with this company again because seems like a quality product.,2
"$10 Chinese product that is not made to last and can possibly hurt you badly when they will snap(and they will). I would caution everyone. Please do some research and buy heavy duty resistance bands made by reputable companies with reviews not by people who use them once and forget them,but by bodybuilders and athletes who put these bands through paces.  Please avoid the heavy set and only use the lightest bands. Do NOT use the 20+lb bands as they will snap quickly. Lighter bands will last a few months.  As others mentioned the manual says they are only designed for 90 days... well, the real ones are designed to last a lfetime.",2
Just bought this product because I wanted to start exercising and didn't want to buy a weight set. I really like this set of resistance bands because they are very versatile and easy to change the amount of resistance you want. The handles are padded and offer a lot of comfort. Not only can you use the bands singularly but you can also add as many bands as you want to increase the resistance. It also comes with at door anchor so you can do pulling exercises and an ankle strap so you can do leg exercises. Comes with a carry bag so you can take your workout with you. Highly recommend.,2
"Have used the product about a dozen times and works as expected. Cons are - the handles are prone to slipping and the stitching from one of the handles which prevents the plastic grip from slipping came apart during a workout. And not a big deal but the handles are a bit loud, making a squeaking sound.",2
"I looked for a product that was actually made by the seller since I had resistance bands by ""big sport brands"" snap while working out. I use the bands during every strength training exercise, incorporating them with free weights and other machines, meaning above average, frequent use. I also stretch close to maximum on a regular basis. I can say that they have performed well for many months, andI will stick with this brand/manufacturer for all future purchases of resistance band products.",2
"Ordered two sets by accident, but I will keep them both.  A must have for men and women with gym training at home",2
works great for when im traveling and no gym is available.,2
I wasn't sure I would like these but when I am setting at my desk I can set on them and do all kinds of exercises.  Love them.,2
My wife uses this product for her recovery therapy for shoulder replacement surgery and it is was recommended by the hospital staff.,2
I purchased this set after reading a lot of good reviews but unfortunately I didn't have the same exp. as others. Initially the quality of the band looked really good but after some use they started to show signs of wear and tear (let me also say that I take care of things that I use) and as of today the status is that my 4 out of 5 bands are broken.,2
Arrived quickly in a practical yet attractive organizing bag.  With 2 sets of these bands I can really tune my workouts.  So now it goes like this: 1.  Do as many unassisted pull ups as possible 2.  Cheat on a lot more pull ups and then stop before damaging shoulder and neck 3.  Use bands to get to 100% failure without a medical emergency  The quick connect system is great- super easy to dial the resistance up and down.  Seriously- good product- why waste your time at a brick & mortar- just have Amazon deliver these suckers in 48 hours or less!,2
"I work out 5 days a week, and I use these 3-4 of those days. I've had these for 5 months, and they've held up quite well. I've even used a tricep rope for doing extensions and they've stood up quite well. I'm not sure how long they'll last, but intend to research and see. I did replace the door anchor with the Bodylastics brand, as it is much better made. I have a picture of my door anchor after 5 months use. The stitching where you put it in the door is starting to fray some. If you buy this set, read the directions. There is an ankle attachment as well. I've never used it, so I don't know how well it holds up, but I will say this; use it on your ankle only. I came across a Facebook post on a fitness page where a guy tied the ankle attachment around his squat rack and did chest flys with it. The attachment broke and hit him in the back. The directions don't mention anything about the ankle attachment, but common sense should kick in and tell you not to use it for chest flys. Anyway, if you buy these, do these things: read the directions, and inspect them before and after each use.",2
"Black Mountain Products makes the best Resistance Bands around. They also have the best life time guarantee, and awesome customer service. I've been using the bands, and over time the years the bands are starting to get worn and splitting, and one email to Black Mountain and they sent me FREE of charge, FREE shipping, replacements on the blue, yellow, and green bands that I use the most. THEY ARE AWESOME FOLKS at BLACK MOUNTAIN!!! You can't go wrong, and they are always there!!!",2
"I've been using the band's for close to two months in between or in place of gym workouts. The bands' build quality is above average in this price range, easy set up and quick resistance change system. Small packaging is very convinient for traveling and use in hotel rooms to maintain routines while traveling. Good buy so far.",2
"Not so sure how this has 4.6 stars. I focused on the good reviews when I purchased when I should've read all the bad ones. The band seem to be of good quality, but the issue is the threading that they use on the ankle strap, handles, door anchor, and the peice that connects the bands to the carabiners. They are all starting to come apart which can be dangerous considering all the metal parts that they use.  I bought these for physical therapy because I was in a car accident. I'm 105lbs, in a wheelchair, and only have 1 arm that I can use. This should prove that I couldn't possibly push these bands passed their breaking point. I used this product a total of 4 times and during one of my exercises I heard the threads ripping so I stopped to check. Good thing I did because taking a metal carabiner + rubberband to my broken leg or arm would have been extremely painful.",2
Excellent set up...Use it about 3-4x a week and it does the job well...lots of options on resistance.,2
These are just what I was looking for! I love how they are packaged and the variety of bands. The handles are sup comfy! The door anchor is a great bonus that brings more options to my workouts. Definitely recommend this product.,2
A friend of mine suggested I look into Black Mountain resistance bands. I read some of the reviews and decided to purchase a set. The bands arrived a few days ago and I tried them.  I haven't exercised in a few years so I'm a little sore. Overall I really like the bands for working out.,2
I was a bit disappointed in these honestly.  Two broke within a month and the colors seem to fade really quickly.  Saf,2
"Decent bands,  wish they had the resistances written on them though.",2
Very nice quality product and it even came with a pair of protective glasses!,2
"Great for the price. This was a gift, the only problem is my son is too strong for these but I have a much cheaper version so I suggested he double them over, problem solved!",2
"Excellent product, good design and quality.  Helped me thru my physical therapy.  I now use these bands for light exercise, whenever on the go or at home when not in the mood for heavy gym exercises.",2
Bought these for my client for when she is out of town and she loves them. Not a question as to how durable they will be!!!,2
"Easy to use, sturdy so far, and it keeps me fitted. Would recommend to anyone.",2
Love these bands. Super high quality. Great supplement to the home gym. Definitely recommend.,2
"I'm a personal trainer and I use these daily. Six months in and still working perfectly! I was so worried they would break but so far, so good!",2
Excellent. I use door attachment. Find it much safer. Like that it's quick to add or subtract bands.. gonna be a long while till I can use all 5 together.,2
"Like the bands, bought the Kinzi bands and they started coming apart durin 1st workout, will recommend to others!!!",2
"I upgraded the handles for these band because I was too sure about the strength of these. I am sure the are fine though, but the thought of catching on of these in the eye. No thanks.",2
"I purchased this to have an exercise option for times when I was traveling and/or did not have gym access for whatever reason.  It was helpful for that.  Compact.  Easy to use.  Not very challenging if you work out a lot, but it is definitely better than nothing.  Would recommend for the purpose I stated above or for a pure beginner that does not have gym access.",2
These are very good bands. Saturday and gives a very good workout. Happy I bought them.,2
Just finished Cardio Rehab and needed some of the equiptment that they had  So Far this is GREAT,2
"Can't take dumbbells with you traveling, but you can take these.  My only complaint is that the door hook is not padded and would scratch a door finish.  It might be OK for hotels which have sturdy doors, but probably not for a residential setting if you want to be invited back.",2
"works great, has the option to use over the door, or on a pull-up bar.",2
The ankle strap broke on first use. Very poor construction on this as the seam holding the metal loop ripped. All the rest is very good and does what is should. Good workout and I really like that you can stack the straps. Too bad on the ankle strap as it made my rating plummet.,2
"Have not been able to start exercise program yet, but I can tell you that they seem well mad!",2
"The carabiners are too big and clunky. Wish they were smaller, less weighty, less scratchy on my skin, and that two sets of handles were included so you could work out with a partner.",2
"After a couple years of very easy indoor use of maybe three times per week, two of the bands just snapped in one weeks time. One snapped and hit me in the face, so I'm not happy. I want a refund or replacement set.",2
"It's like my own portable gym!! Instead of carrying 45lb plates around, i've got this!",2
"Easy to use and high rating for versatility. The product holds up great during long work out sessions. The fact that the resistance bands are stack-able is awesome. I can set the resistance level between 2-4lbs up to 75lbs. The door anchor and comfortable ankle strap add a lot of variety to my work out that I didn't have before. Hand grips are comfortable as well. Instruction and exercise example booklet are helpful and easy to follow. I wish there would have been exercise examples for the leg muscles, though. However, a quick google search and I was good to go. There were some stray strings on the handles but other than that, there were no issues. I called the owner with a few questions. He was easy to reach both times, kind and professional. Great company and great products. Highly recommend.",2
This is a very well designed system. The handles clip on and off the bands easily. The bands have been sturdy and function every bit as good as any I have seen and/or used in the past 25 years. The design for the strap that jambs into the door to anchor the setup is well designed. I did have a problem with the balls that are sewn into the anchor end breaking. Having used other setups with an anchor strap I am not sure why this one had a bit of a malfunction. Even flattened though it is still anchoring. That is why I didn't give it 5 stars because of the anchor strap.  My use of this system is to maintain as much strength as I can after 37 years of disability caused by a neurological condition.,2
"used it for a few weeks, start to tear up, do not buy if you looking for a long term use",2
"I do a lot of computer work for my occupation, and it has been vital for me to take breaks and either stretch out or get exercise.  This purchase, along with an exercise ball and a yoga mat, have been absolutely essential for me to maintain my flexibility, strength, and overall health. These resistance bands are key for convenient strength exercises.  They seem to be built with high quality standards.  And the door anchor works great to add new dimensions to the exercises.  Highly recommend bringing this set into your home or office, or both.",2
"I have tried a lot of different resistance bands over the years but these are by far the best. I love the hooks so I don't have to worry about handles and it allows me to double or even triple up the bands for extra resistance. I highly recommend these to anyone looking for a good, high quality set of resistance bands!! You won't be disappointed.",2
Wife used for rehabbing shoulder injury. Saved time (and money) from having to do exercises at orthopedist's office. Seemed to be high quality.,2
"Just noticed I did not review this item. WOW, I thought resistance training and Bands might have been a gimick. It was the price that got me to get them and test them. Im a believer now. I slam these bad boys into a door, and I get going and don't want to stop. I use them without a door, and entangled in all areas, and have fun with them. They seem very strong, and I do not fear they will snap on me. The threading on the Door jam thingy is coming unraveled a little, but, that would be expected, as I am using them a great deal. Will likely just double stitch them later. All in all, for the price, and how many exercised can be done with these things, I am more than happy. Excellent product.",2
"I'm conflicted over this review, as I loved this product until this morning when I ended up at the hospital getting stitches in the back of my head after the Velcro strap ripped off, sending the d-ring and carabiner flying into my head at 100Mph.  Great bands, just be very careful using the Velcro strap.",2
Well worth the price and working just as expected. I use them daily. No problems.,2
"I had lost overall body strength due a painful hip injury that really hampered my mobility and limited my ability to exercise. I've recovered from surgery and I'm now catching up on recovering strength using this product.  I feel that the continual and steady resistance the bands provide through the entire exercise motion is more efficient in strengthening the targeted muscles than free weights. Steady resistance is much harder to maintain with free weights.  Even at light resistance, these bands provide that steady pressure that can be increased as the muscles strengthen, plus you can hold the pressure at any point during the motion simply by stopping for a count of 3 or 5, etc. This works great, for example, on bicep curls if you hold on the return motion when your elbows are at 90 degrees; makes you feel the burn! This system is allowing me to regain strength slowly, easily and steadily. The bands, the couplings, the handles, etc., are all well-designed and made of high quality materials.  Very well-satisfied with the quality of the product and the efficiency of the system. A big plus is that the set and the system travel very well!",2
"Great set of bands. These are professional quality for a great price, especially with all the extras you get thrown in for free.",2
"A lot of pieces = a lot of options = can get cluttered and complicated. I use the red and black bands. I tried contacting the company to get the free orange band that they offer, but I never got a response. Perhaps they will see this review and send me the orange one. I currently use the red and black together. Not sure what the velcro loop is to used for.",2
These arrived on time and are great quality for the price.  They are exactly what I needed to replace my old ones. These ones seem to be much better quality for a better price! Would definitely purchase again.,2
"Very glad I bought them.  I had been in archery in my younger days.  I didn't pick up a bow for about 15 years.  I've gotten back into shooting a bow again and this has done a lot for my arms, shoulders, and back muscles to help draw and hold my bow.",2
"This was the neatest product I've probably ever purchased in the fitness realm. It's extremely well made. Sturdy. And most of all, effective! I love that I don't have to buy multiple things to get these exercises (like a chin up bar and a set of these bands) or a more pricey system. This is perfectly priced. I HIGHLY recommend!",2
Black Mountain is an A+ brand. Quality shows on every level with these bands. I also have the exercise ball and resistance loop bands. You won't be disappointed in this. Great for traveling so you can still get a muscle work out.,2
Work as a personal trainer. This is hands down the best bands set I've owned.  The clip on design is great and there is a lot of flexibility. Even came with a workout guide for beginners if its something you're just starting. Love it,2
Bands anchor is too small to use on bottom of the door.  Makes certain exercises harder such as bicep curls.,2
"Love these bands.  Toning and working legs for the first time in many years.  I use a simple weight bench which I place against the door jamb and stack the bands totaling  a fair amount of resistance. I can then do forward and reverse leg curls. Legs feel great. I get a very good range of motion from these bands. Would definitely buy again and will soon be purchasing additional bands to add resistance to my workouts.  Have added cable/band routine to now workout and isolate the outside pectoral muscle (flys), abdominal  crunches and twists for the oblique muscle.  Research weight cable machine workouts and most can be adapted for band workouts.  Love them.",2
This was a great product. The bag that comes with it is very convenient and I can actually store a few of my other items in there for park workouts.,2
I like these bands for exercising sine I seldom can go to the fitness center because of compressed disks and sciatica. Has been a great way to exercise.,2
"Exactly what I was looking for. High quality, excellent directions and all in a neat small case that is great for home or travel. Well done Black Mountain Products!",2
"We have been very pleased with our set of exercise bands! They came in a nice zippered pouch with a hanging loop which makes transportation and storage simple. The bands themselves are pretty thick, and so far during use seem durable and of good quality. It's nice that the grip handles are larger so that they accommodate all members of our family for use. Changing the bands has been easy also with a quick carabiner clip! So far they are a solid product!",2
Better than weights only thing company doesn't answer phone for the free band they send,2
Great product and brand to add to a home gym.  Five different weight resistance and can be combined.  So far I am happy with the quality and use of the product.,2
Great product!  I am going through home physical therapy for my shoulder and was using latex bands that kept ripping.  I bought the Black Mountain Resistance Bands and what a difference!  I can really feel the workout on my shoulder.  The different degrees of strenght are great for increasing reistence as you get stronger. I'm sure these are also great for general exercise and strenghening.  They are built with high quality parts.,2
"I originally like these a lot but one of the handles just cracked through normal moderate use.  I would I will update the order depending how this is resolved, but for the price compared to similar products this is pretty disappointing.",2
"I'm using this on the road as part of my fitness training. It packs up into a small bag, and I can stow it basically anywhere in my camper van.",2
Perfect package of resistance bands.  I love that you can easily attach them to any door and the little booklet of exercises comes in handy.,2
These are great to use as home physical therapy. I recently tore my meniscus. You have to maintain the muscle around your knee  your healed enough for weights again. These did the job. Highly recommend.,2
"This Resistance Band Set is well made and certainly a bargain on Amazon at this price.  My wife bought me the set as a gift through her Amazon account, and I'm very pleased she did.  The handles, resistance tubes and clips are nicely machined, and work easily.  I wanted this primarily for traveling, since everything fits in the included bag.  We are scheduled for three weeks on Maui this year, and the bands will be added to our suitcase to give us an exercise option right in the condo, before we go out to the pool or sightseeing. I'm really pleased with the purchase.",2
Great product and exactly what was needed.  I have had bands before and they weren't nearly as nicely made and sturdy as the bands from Black Mountain Products.  It is awesome you can link them to get more weight.  I have used them for a couple weeks and I use them to warm up the rotator cuffs. Some leg work as well.  My wife uses them daily and loves them.  The door stop hasn't failed and seems to be very sturdy too. Great job guys!,2
"Excersise bands arrived in two days and in great condition. The bands seem to be built very well, but with a lifetime warranty who's worrying. These will allow me to take the gym on the road. Booklet that comes with set has a number of excersices in it and YouTube has many more. The tension of the bands provides resistance at all aspects of each excersise. I would definitely buy again!",2
So far so good. Holding up well after 12 months of workouts with Autumn and Shaun T,2
I have never had resistance bands before.  They seem to be great quality.  I didn't know what to expect.  I would buy these again if I ever needed to.,2
Works well with stretching and with resistance. Really enjoy my work outs.,2
Proudct seems to be good quality and 1 week in have no issues. Purchased to continue PT at home on my hip and shoulder.,2
"Use this frequently.  Very well made.  Zero signs of wear after 1 year.  Roommate tried them and said that they're way better than the ones at his gym, and he's paying $40/mo.  Ha!",2
"A few years ago I tore a tendon in my shoulder. I was in physical Therapy for 6 months. about half of my exercises were resistance bands. They were basically strips of latex in different colors for various strengths. They did work and I trained my muscles to be able to function without that one end tendon. Now I wanted to get some new ones to continue exercising mainly in the winter as I am very active the rest of the year. My trainer form blue cross showed me some models out there that were endorsed by Blue Cross. I noticed he used these from Black Mountain that were not on the list. He explained that he was on a budget and the latex tubes are all fairly equal. I did some research and they all last about a year if used every other day. I bought them and they are so much better than I was expecting.  I do get a kick out of the reviews that say this $19.99 is not as nice as the $90 sets. Really? Oh well. They are very sturdy and work perfect for me. I vary my routine but keep the ones going for my shoulder. If you are like me and just need some extra exercise in the winter, I recommend this set.  Like all makes of these check for wear or cracks before starting your routine. I saw one review saying to add Vaseline to make them last longer. I would not do that since it could cause them to slip out of the door jam or even have a chemical reaction. Keep moving. :)",2
"Good product. Came with everything stated and the instruction booklet had good suggestions for some exercises. The reason I gave 4 instead of 5 starts is that there is no indication on the bands themselves for how much resistance they apply. The booklet explains which is which and you can kind of tell by the diameter of the band itself, but some type of brief indication on the band would be appreciated. Overall exactly what I wanted.",2
Bought for my son fwho's a Personal Trainer for Christmas. Thought he can use this. He likes it.,2
Shipped quick and everything was in order. Got this for my duaghter and she loves it. Left her a bit soar after the first work out so it's doing the job.,2
Use these for follow on strengthening of my shoulder after rotator cuff surgery.,2
"Purchased these primarily for my wife to use. I ran them through the paces of doing some HIIT workouts, ranging from doing curls, lateral raises, and lunges to using them for unilateral work. The quality is good and I think this is a great starter set with a good reputation from Black Mountain. I like the fact that you can stack bands to increase resistance and that they are build on clips. The carry bag is pretty flimsy, so don't expect to use this for more than a stuff sack. Mine had the zipper break the second time I used it. Handles are good quality and their is a nice instruction sheet and reference guide for resistance. Black Mountain does offer a more robust set of bands, which I would recommend if you are an avid fitness person. I am and I abuse my gear. I will need the upgrade! This is also a lower price than I paid, so it's a better deal financially! Regardless, good product and the only change I would make is a better carry sack for taking these on the road.",2
I wanted to add a core & strength workout a few times a week and did not want to store a full weight set or go to the gym.  These have been great.  They come with handles that easily clip to the bands and have and ankle strap and door stopper piece.,2
Great to have when traveling or doing at home workouts. You have everything you need. Great quality.,2
Very well made.  Should last a lifetime.  Good weight combination of straps that work for myself and my wife.  Customer service is outstanding.  I would purchase this set again.,2
"Solid construction, sturdy connectors, comfortable handles. I'm not sure the color sequence of easy to hard aligns with the industry standards, and it's not intuitive. [Red harder than black? Green harder than blue?] They don't seem lifetime quality, but a really good value for the price.",2
just got these I think they will be great... now to just use them.  Really like the way they show how to use them.. now I have no excuse,2
"Use the bands for all kinds of exercises. Daughter bought an additional set for traveling  and use in  hotels without a gym,",2
"LOVE THEM! I am very satisfied with this set. I thought it was going to be easy to use them but they are harder than they look. I use them in combination with free weights to ass resistance without having to go super heavy because I workout at home and the floor isn't made for extreme heavy weights. These work perfectly for home gym Interval training and Functional training. I'm still trying to figure out a way to attach them to my T-Bar rower. Gears are turning, I'll figure it out. ;) Good stuff Black Mountain Products! Excellent product and made well.  1/7/2017 update I figured out a way to use them with my T-bar rower. I connect the Bands to themselves then loop around the bar wrap a towel around the bar to keep the RB from sliding then step on the RB on the floor. I tested two 15 lb. dumbbells with the green band (10-12 lbs) and I could barely get 3 reps! I am going to enjoy these RBs wholeheartedly! Thank you again, Black Mountain! Oh yeah, there is an orange band promotion that I can call and get a FREE orange (35-40) band to add to the set! Calling in the Morning. :) Very happy with this product!  update 1/9/17 I have my FREE orange RB coming from Black Mountain and I also bought the Purple RB (45-50 lbs.) as well. I now have plenty of resistance for using them for my functional training home gym. I actually want to buy one more complete set and the few additional RBs so I can do even more with them as well as combining them with free weights. The gentleman on the phone when I ordered my free orange RB was awesome. Great customer service!  Update 10/09/2017 I bought a second set along with two atomic green (70-75) bands. Fantastic training tool. I found several videos for using RBs and I love it! I now have four handles, two ankle straps, and two door anchors so I can double up on stuff like ""heel to hand"" for hamstrings or I can set up to do more than one exercise without having to change everything in between sets. Now I just need one more Orange and one more Purple to complete the second set. Later I want to also buy the Loop Resistance band set. Amazing products and amazing company. ten stars  Update 1014/2017 Bought the last of the two RBs I needed to complete my second set. (the Orange and Purple RBs). Very Happy about this product and their additional RBs.",2
Very versatile workout kit and packs in a nice small kit. Great for traveling and stores in small areas.,2
"To tell the truth I haven't used these as much as I had intended to. They are good quality and nicely made. The bag is super handy too, so you don't have bands laying everywhere!!",2
"Great quality bands, feel sturdy in your hands. Ive had other that felt like they were going to snap, not these. Would suggest these to anyone in the market. Top rated and top quality!",2
"I have been using these for over a month now and really like them.  No breakage and they feel real solid.  The only thing that I would like to do or see them sell is a d-ring that can be permanently installed on a door frame.  It gets really old doing one exercise and then having to open up the door slide the ring up the jam and then close the door again and then repeat for the next one.  I would like to just have 3 d-rings where you can clip to for a quick change.  Outside of that, the handles are soft and seem strong enough to last at least a year of constant use.  The bands also look like they will hold up and not break.  I have purchased other types that snapped within the year.  These look much better made than those.",2
"Must have for home workouts, multi types of exercises can be done with either using the door or exercising freely with the resistance bands.",2
"Versatile, sturdy, and able to make your own resistance by clipping as many together as you want.  I've had them for two plus years and used them alot.  Will be taking these to travel with me.",2
Good. Prefer this to weights when I have the time. I might purchase additional handles and ankle straps if offered so I do not need to change them between exercises.,2
Product came as described and works well at home using the door attachment. I researched a few brands before buying and this was the best for the $$!,2
"My wife uses resistance bands every day, she even takes them to her physical therapy appointments. She likes the quality and the book that comes with the bands is very useful. I would buy these again no questions asked.",2
"good build, able to do all exercises, great for vacation when you don't have access to gym",2
"These resistance bands are perfect for anyone because they come with bands of all different ""weights"". Set up is easy and the bands are all very durable. One thing that would be nice is if the weight of each band was written somewhere on the band so you could easily pick it out without checking the instructions.",2
Great product at a great price. About two years ago I started trying to be healthy and working out regularly. I have been looking for things at home to change things up. This is a small thing that can give you variety (without taking up tons of space).,2
somehow my set of these got tossed and i cant even describe to you how much i miss these things! its winter and theres no where to go and nothing to do so i need to do something in the house and these really helped to keep me busy and build strength at the same time. I've dropped a dress size. I will be buying these again the moment i get some money again!,2
Great pack to bring along while traveling for a quick easy workout!,2
I like them. I have bought others and these seem to be pretty nice. Price is right as well. I bought this set to use in my office at work. These have meet my expectations. No complaints.,2
"I've had a set of these and recently purchased a 2nd set.  They're great.  They're not perfect, but as far as other band products in this range go, these are probably as good as it gets.  The ability to stack the weight on these bands really makes these stand out from other bands out there.  Here is how I use these:  ==Cardio==  -Resistance for doing punching movements, over the head movements, etc - greatly increases core, shoulder, & tricep/bicep activation(depending on how its held).  I recommend checking out Tapout XT & Tapout XT2 for many movements and how to do this.  -Anchor the bands under your feet and hold the bands over your head while doing squats  -Several other creative ways to incorporate bands to increase cardio & muscle activatio  ==Muscle Building & Hypertrophy==  That's right, you can really build muscle with these!  If you have no weights and want to work on building muscle, then these are a great replacement to start using.  Have weights and don't think you need these?  Think again.  -You can use the bands themselves like you would for regular weights for most muscle building exercises.  The big difference is that resistance bands have a different strength curve than weights, so you work your muscles in different ways  (at the end of the rep, the resistance will be the greatest, whereas regular weights will either be constant or decrease)  -You can combine weights and bands together in a single movement (holding the band & weight, or have the band anchored on the weight) to increase the resistance and difficulty of an exercise (ex. regular dumbell curls are hardest when your arm is at 90 degrees, band curls are hardest at the top of the curl, holding a dumbell and band together with the band anchored in front of you makes the whole thing hard from beginning to end).  -With the door & pole anchors, you can use these bands like you would any cable machine at the gym.  I recommend buying 2 sets of bands, or getting a different option that includes 2 pole anchors and matching pairs of bands to get the most out of this option.  I've used Athlean X/X2 for a lot of tricks on using bands in my weight lifting routine (check him out on youtube)  These bands are super quick to stack on, just clip the carabiner to the handle.  It takes seconds to add/remove bands.  To fine tune how much resistance you want, you can also step closer/farther away from the anchor point.  The included pole anchor works great and is very handy.  Having 2 of these (from the 2 orders of the product) makes for a good cable machine substitute since I will anchor these to the poles on my squat rack (I have the base of the squat rack weighed down by a couple of 70 lb dumbbells to make sure it doesn't move).  The handles work great.  They have hard plastic handles with soft foam on the outside to make them nice to grip.  The only downside to this package is the door anchor.  It doesn't seem to be very forgiving if there is a tiny gap in the door.  Other bands that I've used with a door anchor have a larger, harder foam piece about 1"" square so that if there is a gap in the door, it won't easily slid through.  The only thing I wish about these bands is that they would build in a fail safe.  I've seen other bands that have either a nylon sleeve on the outside (expensive bands), or some sort of rope on the inside so that if a band happens to break, it won't come snapping back at your face.  PSA: always check your bands to see if there are any cuts/fraying.  When they fail, they fail quickly and it hurts!",2
"Easy to use, much better than having a set of weights at home.",2
"It's a shame because I mean they work well enough, but the clips that you use to hook the bands to the handles are very cheap and weak. This one broke the first time I tried using it. BMP said they stand behind their products, but they did not respond to my several email inquiries about getting a replacement.",2
been working with them for a while know nothing broke or come apart yet use about three times a week sometimes 4 good for toning body,2
"This is a great product.  I have a rotator cuff problem in both shoulders.  So, I was looking for a set of resistance bands that would give me a mild to moderate work out.  The yellow and blue bands are perfect for my needs.  They are just the right tension.  Furthermore, changing the bands is a snap.  The grips are great, too, and the entire set can be packed in the zippered bag that is included with the purchase.  There are many band sets available.  I think I made the best choice!",2
"I would have given 5 stars, but the plastic under the foam on the handles broke. I was only using the first 2 easy straps and do not know how this happened. The straps or tubes themselves are great and well worth the cash. (I only gave 3 stars because of the handles breaking the straps are some of the best I have used.)",2
I'm so happy with this kit.  I just wish it was anti-snapping like some of the other ones but none have come close to snapping yet.  Everything seems like really high quality and I enjoy using these.,2
"I suffer from degenerative disc disease and spinal stenosis, among other back problems.  I've always worked out and kept in shape.  Since my back condition has worsened, my dr recommend that I stop lifting heavy weights and try using different exercise bands.  I've been using these BMP resistance bands for several weeks.  I absolutely love them.  They are very convenient to use, especially if you travel.  I can adjust the amount of weight or resistance by the color of the bands .  I use the bands to do a variety of exercises, in place of swinging my heavier iron.  Great for building strength by doing more reps with less weight.  I highly recommend this company, as well as, these bands.",2
The grips are great. The band's are much weaker than I was expecting.,2
"I'd been looking for resistance bands and found these on sale, and I'm glad I got them! They're a little stiff for the first couple of uses, but they soon loosen up and work well. They're also compatible with other resistance band handles, so more than one person can use the bands at once (just keep in mind that every band has a different amount of resistance). These are now a permanent part of my workout routine.",2
"Nice variety of parts here. I replaced the handles with ones that are more heavy duty, but the bands and anchors are good.  Thinking about getting a second set so I can have more of the heavier bands. I like how you can combine different colors to get just about any weight.",2
"Portable, efficient, simple -- an elegant way to work out your arms. It does more body parts than that, but I use it for an arm/back/pec workout. Throw it in the car and use it during lunch hour! All you need is a strong door that locks.",2
Product works excellent. Easy assembly and comfortable in your hand. I would recommend it for anyone who enjoys fitness.,2
"My first set had some rusty carabiners that prevented them from easily opening and closing. Amazon is shipping me a replacement set. The rest of the items looked really nice and probably deserve a 4 or maybe even a 5 star rating.  Edit: Having received my 2nd set in 2 days (thanks Amazon!) I am changing from 3 stars to 5. I also spoke to customer support regarding an ""Orange"" band promotion they are currently running.  They answered on the first ring and were super polite.  This seems like a small business with a great product.  Am guessing my first set had just sat around a bit too long in the Amazon warehouse or were just a fluke. I've only used them a couple of times now but am really enjoying the whole resistance band workout... especially as I recover from a broken clavicle.  My only complaint is the grips have some imprints from other parts due to tight packaging but I believe over time it won't be too huge of an issue.",2
"I only give 5 stars for products that deserve it. You get more than you pay for with this band system. I found this product searching for Crossover Symmetry bands. While they are not the same quality of Symmetry bands, they are only a fraction of the cost. You would need a second set of bands to perform crossover exercises, but that still is a way better value than the expensive Crossover Symmetry bands. I'm very happy with my purchase.",2
Awesome!  it's every thing they describe in their add.  also with a life time warranty it's the last resistance bands you'll ever buy!  what a deal!!!,2
Really cool bands it's cool to how you can hook up more then one to increase the band weight. They also come with a door piece as well should you want to not have to use your feet.,2
"These do what they advertised they would, but I expected the resistance to be higher based on the description.  They're still useful, but not as much as I hoped.  The various exercise diagrams are a nice tough, and the nylon handles have been durable.",2
Just received and used for only one workout so far. The bands and hardware appear to be good quality. I ordered additional door anchors so I don't have to keep changing positions. So far happy with product and I will try to post later on after good amount of useage.,2
Good quality. They have been used daily and I have not had any issues with them. Good for rehab.,2
"I don't excercise with these, I use them for walking my huge dogs along with ropes. Shipping was fast and they were exactly what I needed. They work great!",2
"Excellent product, easy to use, instructions are spot on.  For flexibility, stretching and strength maintenance you could not ask for a better product",2
I work over the road as a locomotive engineer. Staying across the road doesn't always allow me to workout like I would like. This has been a wonderful kit to bring with me for those stays. I use them at home when I'm feeling like I don't want to workout around other people. The band's seem to be quality along with the metal d rings and carabiners. Also included is a pamphlet of the resistance of each band and a handful of workouts.,2
"Really like this set, works as described.  Obviously portable, so can use anywhere.",2
"Nice simple set of resistance bands and grips. The door grip is great and effect - no snap-backs to date after a couple of months of use in different doors while traveling. Resistance range is nice and bands can be combined to increase easily. Handgrips are solid and comfortable, nicer than the ones that came with my bowflex machine",2
"Very nice, heavy duty, plenty of choice for different weights for different exercises. I had watched YouTube videos of this Black Mountain set before ordering and the product is just as shown in the videos! Resistance Bands are great for a quick workout before getting dressed for work. Haven't been on vacation this year but plan to take the set with me when I go!",2
Ordered 2 sets for my personal training studio to use normally and for a homemade functional training rig! They are awesome! I like the metal clips on the end. It allows you to change handles and you can buy other types of handles to use with the bands!,2
Cool bands.  Got two sets to add a little resistance to body weight movements.,2
"WOW, what a deal here. The bands, handles, bag as well as the straps to attach to a post or other vertical object as well as on a door are all top quality. I like the color coded bands and will use these regularly for my workouts.",2
Great set that is definitely worth the money. Fantastic travel supplement to a gym. I also use it for rehab for my shoulder. Tons of different workouts one can do with this set. Quality seams good so far.,2
"Great set! Includes everything you need to get a good workout anywhere. Multiple bands, handles that you can attach more than one band to, ankle strap, exercise instructions, door anchor, and carry bag. Small, lightweight, packable. But effective! Highly recommend as an option for those who travel a lot and want to do weight training, for those who don't have a lot of space for weights, and for those who need to do a gentler form of weight training due musculoskeletal or joint issues that require a gentler, lighter approach. Completely customizable to your needs.",2
"Although I have used resistance bands with the Physical Therapist and also with my Bowflex, this is the the first set of Bands that I have purchased.  I really enjoy these resistance bands, they are a safe way to perform practical, strength building exercises and they can be taken anywhere.  The resistance bands have helped me recover from Knee Surgery and also from Tendonitis. This is a great set for a great price and I recommend it to people of all body types!",2
Works just as good as any others.. Not sure how long they will last since I've only had them a month or two and don't use them every day.. But it comes with an awesome guide!,2
"I really like these for the home gym, they work great. I've had one set for two years now and just bought a second because I needed more bands. The first set still works perfectly and they get daily use!",2
These are a nice set of bands. I had shoulder surgery and they work great for rehab.  You can add more bands to increase resistance. I have used some other brands before but this is a nice set and the bands don't lose their resistance like some of the others I have used. The door anchor works great and the metal clips are nice compared to other brands.  I was always a free weight only guy but I can get a good workout with these bands and now supplement my free weights with them. Hopefully I will not have to use their warranty but from what I have read and seen Black Mountain stands behind their products.,2
My daughter loves this set.  Perfect for increasing her dance flexability.  It would have been great if it had 2 ankle straps,2
Used these bands at least a dozen times already and have had no issues,2
This is a great set. Works very well for all kinds of exercises.,2
"these are good. Love them. I work 12 hours a day so I can't always hit the gym, but I used these during my breaks, lunch, and general downtime, have come in handy.",2
I bought these to go with a P90X-style workout.  I was surprised by how much resistance they provided!  Switching bands during the workout is pretty simple with the carbinar connections.  Very satisfied with this purchase.,2
It is convent .Easy to use. Compact enough to take anywhere.,2
Seem durable. Nice set. Easy to use and combine for added resistance.,2
These have made life much easier for many of my workout buddies. Thought I would give them a try.,2
These bands are great and you get a very good variety of tensions.  You can get an excellent workout with them and you can use them for a whole body work out.  Great quality product,2
Love it! Very useful when you have to work out in a small space.,2
"I love these. Resistance bands are like having a portable cable tower at a tiny fraction of the price, though most are difficult to stack, thus making adjustments to resistance difficult. This set solves that problem. Switching out bands is very easy and there's room for additional ones, as I found out already, since I bought and added the purple stackable band to mine. I'll likely be adding the orange and atomic green, for a total of about 230 pounds of resistance. Which is not much lower than most cable weight stacks go up to, and for a total investment of like $75. Versus hundreds (or even thousands) for a cable tower. Bands have received an unfortunate reputation by their association with light-resistance high-rep use in trendy women's fitness programs, but I assure you that has nothing to do with their inherent nature.",2
These bands have stood the test of time and strength... There are several bands that can be used separately or together to create more resistance as necessary.  They are great when traveling to get a quick workout in.  The door anchor is handy to create even more exercise options...,2
The system of 5 bands that can be added onto each other works very well and provides the weight I need. Recommended to all.,2
These are ok if you are traveling or in a place where you can not hit the gym. I do wish they came with an option of putting around a pole. You must have a door for these. But does work.,2
These bands have provided a very simple way to workout at home with the conveniency of making it on my own time! I have enjoyed using the bands and the accessories that come with them. The additions besides the bands allows for an easy way to turn one's living room into his or her own gym at home! No problems with them whatsoever!,2
"The husband and I have been using these for a month now and they are holding up well.  Easy to use and the straps are strong.  I took off one star for the carabiner-style clips that attach the band to the handles.  They have sharp metal bits around the hinge area and anywhere the metal is cut - as if they weren't polished or finished properly.  They cut my finger tips every time I change bands and have to be careful not to touch anywhere near the cut metal.  I imagine if they used better quality carabiners, the price would go up dramatically since the metal is probably the most expensive component of this set, so for what it is, I'm pleased with this brand.  It's a good value for everything you get.",2
"Just as described. They work well. And it even comes with a free orange band, you just have to call the company to send it to you! Great bargain!",2
"I purchased these as a Plan B for exercise while traveling, for my off days from yoga, and a nice outdoor stretch/workout on the weekends. I've only used it a couple times, but it seems really sturdy and haven't had any issues. The door anchor works great too! My only complaint is the straps do rub on your arms when doing certain resistance exercises. For example, while standing on the band and doing bicep curls, the straps rub on the forearms, but It's not too terrible.",2
Very nice. easy to use. There web page has allot of diff pics of diff work outs you can do. Deff wore me out in 15 min.. Ugh..,2
BEST THING EVER!! Great quality and I love how you can switch from one band to another is seconds,2
These are great and I really like the attachment for doing pull-ups and working lats. When I travel not too many hotel gyms have a pull-up bar.,2
"Convenient storage in the bag it comes with. Seems to be made with good quality, overall satisfied with this purchase.",2
"This is a good product and the company seems to sell only quality. The bands can be stretch by 400% their original size without breaking.  the handles and the elastic plastic feel nice and are not flimsy.  My only complaint is that i needed bands with higher tension, but the red tension band at thirty pound lets me train my muscles, but the yellow and blue band are very low weight. I don't know what i would do with those",2
"I use these daily in my workouts since I workout at home. I use them in place of any cable exercises and for increased resistance for some body weight exercises. I've used some with plastic clasps before and it was a huge mistake, they snapped on me. These are very strong and you can tell they are well reinforced. The handles are soft to use.",2
"I compete Nationally in Olympic style weightlifting, and purchased these for home use for myself and my mother for general fitness use.  The tubing for each band is a very high quality, and I do not have to worry about them breaking. They each come with their own carabiners, which makes changing resistance band very simple and easy. The doorstop is a must for any serious use of the resistance bands, and the inclusion of this speaks about the seriousness and quality of Black Mountain Products. No shortcuts were attempted when making this product.  The starter guide is a nice inclusion, but of no real use for me, as is the ankle strap.  I use this resistance bands for specific purposes, and do not condone their use as a sole fitness instrument. However, that being said, for the purposes I use them, they are absolutely fantastic and could not be improved.  I am very happy with these resistance bands. Of all bands I have used, none can compare to these quality.",2
"Have used 4-5 times in workouts and what I like most are the number of bands, and the fact that there are some easy baby level bands in there for wimps like me.  Those exercises I tried and failed at because the bands were stronger than an ox and my noodle arms are not ox like at all...well, the little yellow and blue guys in this pack are FANTASTIC.  I can work out with the big boys now.  Not five stars since don't know how hold up over long time, but that's a minor thing, and shouldn't deter you from dropping the very minimal amount of $ they charge for these.  Like the carabeeners since it makes combining the bands easy.  I even used handles from another set - just clipped them on and done.  Don't over think this - it's got a billion and one positive ratings, and if you are starting out like me, this has enough resistance to get you kicked off.",2
Excellent product. The wife and I really enjoy working out together and being able to use different strengths of bands. Well built and would recommend this all day long.,2
I really like this set. It includes everything you need to do exercises using resistance bands with a door.  I like that I can take these with me if I am traveling.  I think this is a good product for those working from home with limited equipment.  I use the bands for back exercises mostly but I know you can use it for other exercises (I just haven't tried out).  This equipment is useful to use with strength training DVDs for people who work out at home and don't have heavier weights.,2
"My physical therapist gave me stretch bands to use at home to exercise my neck muscles. The bands would break and I could not do the exercises. Now, I can do my exercises, along with others with the direction book.",2
"This kit came with everything I needed, and all of the bands have held up very well. No breaks, no cracking, no splitting. The handles are comfortable to use, and the whole kit travel well.",2
"I have never used resistance bands so I can't compare them with other brands but I really like using these. I mostly only lift but I am limited at home because weights and benches are expensive. When I need to get in my workout but the gym is not an option these are a good substitute. I love that they come with a door holder so I can place the band I'm going to use at any height. The ankle strap and hand pulls are very good quality, actually this entire set is good quality and I can tell it's made well and made to last. I didn't think that using bands would ever compare to lifting but if I'm creative enough with the workouts I'm definitely sore the next two days. It also comes with a huge list of exercises to help you get started.",2
"I love this set and would definitely recommend it. It's a very comprehensive set that is easy to set-up. The varying bands definitely provide increased intensity which I like from other sets. They can easily transition between arm sets and leg sets using your body weight or a door jam. You simply slide the band into the included door wedge and close the door on the wedge. The comfort handles are easily attached with a carabiner styled system. The handles are very comfortable to use. The system seems secure and of a solid quality for long use. As a woman without a lot of existing upper body strength, these are a great solution instead of using free weights. I love the travel bag, which means I can take my set wherever I go so I don't miss work out days. The included training steps are well pictured and easy to follow for an initial routine.",2
love the bands but missing the over door attachments great for general full body workout when on the go,2
"I purchased these looking for an alternative to free weights and weight machines altogether.  As a retired and disabled veteran, my body aches at the thought of weightlifting.  So I decided to go with resistance conditioning for the purpose of general overall health maintenance and conditioning.  This kit is the perfect beginners kit, plus as your strength and balance improves, additional band(s) can be purchased with varying weight resistances.  I love the fact that it's portable and can be taken along with you on vacations, weekend getaways, etc.  The resistance bands have a life time warranty, and from what I've read, hassle free.  Pricing, lifetime warranty, convenience and practicality; this is a no brainer, especially for those like me who have physical disabilities and limitations, (physical therapy); and for those without such limitations and just want a blast of a work out, this is the way to go.  As with any exercise equipment or the starting of a new workout routine, always consult with your physician and not your neighbor or best bud!!!!",2
"I love these bands. They're great to workout at home or on the go. They are a lot stronger than they appear, and you can stack them to really add some heavy weight. Great for beginners or pros.",2
Purchased this along with the Resistance Loop Bands.  Great workout and very versatile to so many exercises.  Strong and durable helps it last for years.  Very glad we purchased and love the instructions.,2
This products does not pass the test of time and by that I mean less than a year. My brothers and I use these bands just about every day and I guess you could say that we use them more than your average person. That being said all the bands have tears in them and one has completely ripped and one of the handles is broken. So if your actually going to be using them more daily they will eventually rip. I guess the saying is right you get what you pay for.,2
Product came brand new and as described. Great quality. Highly recommend this seller.,2
"I really like this resistance band set. I have been using them for a couple of months now, and I have been really happy with the quality. I've tried to really put these through the ringer and they have easily withstood all these tests. My weight bench and weights are on my porch, so using these are a great option to get a workout inside in the coll A/C during the hot summers.",2
"As I received this, I started using it. Love the quality of the bands and the different accessories for it. I really bought this to help in my P90x workout and so far so good. Definitely recommended!",2
"I have a whole room full of various exercising equipment. This is most practical and diverse exercising equip I have ever bought. Very useful for traveling, and I use it at home as well. Good for beginners. as well as experienced professional athletes. I keep discovering new ways to use the bungee bands, with creative and new strengthening exercises. And the equip is so inexpensive. Must have for beginners, exercising at home, No Gym membership required.",2
Great kit for an at home work out. I use them three days on and one day off. Most of my workouts with them consist of either stepping on them or using them on the side of a door.,2
"These work well and the variety is nice. Color coding helps to separate the different resistances, but these would really be helpful if the resistance was printed on the clip holder. Because of this I took one star since I have to write them on there myself and other similar products have this feature. I chose this over other options since it was multiple bands in one package and being able to clip on different attachments has been useful.",2
Love these multi functional bands great asset to our gym. Thanks,2
Nicely made quality product. Straps and handles feel good and the bag to store them in is really nice.,2
"Great product. I bought it to straighten my shoulders after watching some videos, and this item is very useful for this. Package and parts are also very practical. I had it for like 1 month and I use it for other exercises now. It's like having a small gymnasium in a pouch. Also, you can find lots of videos about how using those bands. 100% recommended.",2
"Haven't used them yet. Shipped fast. As described, pictured and expected.",2
"Great design and easy to use. The quality is wonderful and the company is wonderful as well. Awesome workout with these bands! They travel wonderfully and working out using this easy clicking /carabiner  system makes changing or adding bands to the handles very easy. You can use 1, or several bands at the same time! Excellent design and very sturdy! I called the company to tell them how much I love these bands.",2
I've always come from using weights and to be honest ... these seem like good bands? But I just don't think I like bands.,2
"Bought to use for rehab on my shoulder based off the recommendation of my trainer.  Packaging: Unboxing this was a pleasure. Everything comes nicely enclosed in a carry pouch which makes traveling with it really easy.  First Impression: The material that the bands as well as the attachments is made to last. So far I have not found a single area where poor decisions were made on design or implementation. I have been using this product 3-4x a week for the past few months in parallel to a normal weight lifting routine. I have found that in doing so, my overall strength has increased as well as the rehab on my elbow and shoulder complete. Since starting to use this product, I have purchased a second one to keep in my office at work for days where I am unable to get out or when my elbow/shoulder are feeling blah.",2
"I use this for arms, back, chest and shoulders. I am I I I'm very pleased with the product! The hand grips are great! The amount of resistance is easy to adjust, safer than weights and more convenient. Seems really well made and sturdy.",2
"So I don't usually write negative reviews, but I have to for this one. I bought these to replace a Tower cable system which I used for 5 years and finally snapped. These don't even come close to it. The bands and clips feel flimsy. The door anchor is fine, but it feels like if you pull too hard it'll pull the whole door off the hinges. My two issues are the fact that really cannot do any exercise below the waist since there is no way to anchor at the bottom of the door, unless your door is hung poorly and is flush to the floor. The bands are also way too long. I'd recommend try another product, this one just doesn't cut the mustard.",2
My husband works out with these everyday. These worked with his t25 work out videos. However the Green band has already snapped and broke.,2
"I've added these to my home workout equipment and I love how they're stackable, but also fit in the bag to be neatly put out of the way. Very durable. Input quite a beating on them daily and have been using them for almost 90 days and haven't experienceseen any tears or snags. The handles are comfortable as well.",2
"I bought these for my husband and he is super happy with them. He really likes that he can switch the bands and ""customize"" the weight of the bands by changing and pairing up different resistances. Like that is comes with the door anchor and the travel bag is a nice addition.",2
"These things are STURDY. We always check for safety before use, and we have never had any issues with using these while working out. The bands have different strengths which is good for us because my husband is much stronger than I am so it is nice to have bands that work for us both.",2
Good quality and great portability for folks who may travel. Google resistance band workouts and these will come in very handy.,2
The bands are really good!  I work with bands for therapy all the time and they seem like they will hold up for a while and are a really good price for what all you get!  The door attachment will really help as well!,2
"This is a great bands set!  I love the bag that they all come in, the sturdy weight of the tubes, the sturdy clips, & overall great quality of the product.  My guy & I use these at least once a week, rotated into our weight-lifting routine. I definitely recommend!",2
"Not enough handles, and are expensive when you buy them separately; live and learn. Otherwise, tubes work well.",2
"I decided to start exercising at home since it was more convenient than going to the gym.  I didn't have the money or space to purchase a set of free weights, so I read about these resistance bands.  I assumed I wouldn't get the same kind of workout than I could from using all the different machines at the gym...but I was wrong.  I can do almost anything with these resistance bands, and I can really feel the workout.  I used pretty heavy weights at the gym so I thought I might end up needing more resistance but I typically use at most two bands and not even the ""heaviest"" ones.  The manual that comes with the bands has pages of different exercises and I haven't event gotten to every one of them.",2
"I have been using these for rows among other things, haven't used each weight yet - but so far so good.",2
"AWESOME!  Only 4 stars because that door stopper, doesn't work that great.",2
"Great product but wish manual explained ankle strap.  Perfect for pull-ups using door attachment, can double bands for more resistance.",2
Arrived on time.  I use this at least 3 times a week.  Gives me a good workout.,2
This is a very solid product. it is compact enough to pack easily for on-the-road workouts. I highly recommend it.,2
Good quality and easy to use. A gym in a bag!,2
"Great, sturdy, and easy to use. Clips catch on a little rough though so it a little difficult to change out cables swiftly.",2
"I haven't been using these for long, but so far I think this is a great set of resistance tubes. They are better quality than the ones I've used in physical therapy. I love being able to clip one or more bands onto the handles in order to increase the tension/resistance. Not that I'm at that level yet, but it's great to know I can go beyond just these five bands. It also comes with an ankle strap, a door anchor, and a nice, nylon zipper bag.  I went ahead and got the resistance band workout book to go with this set, and together I think it will be easy to get a good workout at home or if/when travelling. I would definitely look to this company again for further accessories for this set when it comes time to build on it or if anything starts to wear out.",2
Exactly what I wanted quality seems good. Nice bag for storage.,2
"I've had these bands for over a year. They are still in great shape after being used about 5 times a week. I love the option to ""stack"" them which allows you to increase your resistance as you get stronger. The ease in using these in the door make this a perfect option for anyone with out a large room to exercise in and ideal for someone traveling. They are easy to use and come with a guide that tells you how much weight each band equals in case you forget. Definitely worth the purchase price!",2
"I like how exercise bands offer exercises that would otherwise take up a lot of space in a home if using weight benches, dumbbells, etc. So far so good as far as durability goes. Haven't used them all that much so I'll probably update at a later time.  Has anyone tried using a tricep rope, hand bars, etc attached to the bands on a door? I'm wondering if the triceps rope, bars would damage the bands.  A suggestion for the company Black Mountain would be to make a longer booklet of exercises you can do with these bands or a DVD.",2
"I take this with me to train clients on the go and on every vacation!  I love that the handles easily change from one strap to the other, or you can double them up!  The door attachment is GREAT too!  This is a perfect item for any fitness buff.  Perfect for people who travel a lot but can't rely on hotel gyms.  This kit has almost everything you need.  The carrying bag is nice too.",2
"Update 09/02/16: After a couple of years, the black band finally wore through at the center, mostly from abrasion against the edges of the door strap.  The red band got so stretched out it can't be far behind.  I used those two bands for pretty much every workout, though.  The great part - I e-mailed BMP about the replacement band warranty, Rich responded in a day, and had my replacements in the mail immediately at no cost to me!  I just got them a couple days later.  Fantastic service, and a great product I'll continue to use for my home and travel workouts!  Original Review: I'm a lifelong weightlifter and bought these to take on a several-month trip where I wouldn't have access to a gym.  They worked great once I got used to the difference of using resistance bands instead of regular weights.  I mostly used the red, black and blue together for heavier exercises like standing bicep curls (the bands passing under my feet to anchor them), took off the blue for tricep pulldowns and lat rows, used just the red for front and lateral delt raises, and so on.  Coupled with other bodyweight-only exercises I got a full, toning workout while traveling.  I didn't build up muscle, but I stayed in good shape.  And if you roll the bands up carefully, the whole bag flattens down nicely to fit in the front outside pocket of a suitcase.  The anchor-strap was great with almost every doorway I used it on, too...there were a couple that were obviously too weak to support the kind of stress I was going to put on them.  And you have to place it so the strap won't slide towards you the first time you pull, or you might do very minor damage to the wood or paint.",2
no more trainer  these r great and so convenient  i just wish they came with an extra set of hand grips,2
"Purchased these for my wife for Christmas, she really likes them. They can be used anywhere, anytime. Comes with a nice little bag to keep everything together.",2
"I have been using these bands in my work out routine and have been very happy with them. There are five bands of varying resistance. Each band has a pretty quality carabiner at each end, which I really like. I bought a set of Perfects at Wal-mart and they only came with three bands and no metal whatsoever (and only lasted a few months before snapping). This set is already more impressive. I have actually started using the old handles from the broken set with the extra bands that came with this B.M.P set. Using resistance bands for the first time can be a little odd, but once you build a routine with them they actually become a strong asset to your work-outs.",2
I only use these when traveling. I haven't been smacked in the face yet. (good for emergencies too -- suitcase zipper malfunction),2
Good for working those muscles when you can't get out to the gym. Bought for my sister who is primarily home bound and in a wheel chair so she can so some muscle strengthening workouts.,2
"First, shipping was very fast and the company provided their number so you can reach them directly. Bands are incredible - very well made, sturdy and I expect these will last for many years. I think the scale of pounds per resistance bands is true to the rating. I would like something stronger than the red and black bands for squats and lunges.  Men will need heavier bands than women, especially for a lower body workout. It does come with a detailed book detailing the various full body workouts using the bands.  I will definitely be taking this with me on my work trips as I can do these in my hotel room.",2
"This has been a great addition to my at home gym. All bands, door mount and ankle strap are high quality and are easy to use. The travel/storage bag makes keeping things organized a breeze and the cost for this compared to buying each band separate just can't be beat.  Very happy with his purchase.",2
"I've bought three sets of these things and love them!  I, unfortunately, lost my first set when I was living overseas and bought another one when I came back home and can't imagine using another brand. The quality is fantastic. The bands themselves are very resilient and last a very long time. I haven't had one snap on me yet (and yes, I have had that with other brands, like Gold's Gym) and am very happy with everything BMP includes in the bag. It's very easy to swap out bands, I really appreciate the cheat sheet the include to see the different what resistances is equivalent to what weight, although I wish they would upload a PDF copy of it to their site.  I've recommended this set to my friends and have bought one as a present for someone who was starting fitness for the New Year. Great product all around!",2
"Awesome quality bands. I've used quite a few in the past and these are just much more ""rugged"" and sturdy. Great item at this price.",2
Really wonderful and excellent product And helps to build your muscles are excellent,2
This is the perfect training/workout combination. Easy to use and many different ways to use the bands. Love the handles the bands come with with the door holder! A must have.----Ohh and the bag that comes with makes it easy to store and take anywhere.,2
"I've been using this product for about a week now, and so far it has been great. I have been using them as a supplement to my strength training routines. They're great for resistance training. The door anchor is great, too. It seems pretty sturdy. Hopefully I can get a lot of use from these.",2
"I just got this set yesterday as well as a set from another company so I could compare the quality. The other set seems to be made pretty well, but these from Black Mountain are higher quality. The nylon webbing and hardware are heavier and have an overall better quality look. I've been using resistance bands for years. Not as my sole resistance routine, but to suppliment my exercise machines and free weights. Everyone that exercises should give bands a try if they haven't as they are very effective. As these eventually wear out as they all do in time, I'll replace them with Black Mountain products again. My only complaint is there is a slip of paper that came with the bands offering me a free orange band, but the phone number given doesn't seem to connect to anything.",2
This is a great travel set and the bag is nice to be able to throw in my travel bag.,2
"I really wanted to like this product!  I always see the women in the work out videos using these! However, they are VERY long!  That is saying quite a bit because I am about 5""6 and have rather long arms.  If anyone has any advice as to make them smaller I am all ears.  Perhaps I am missing something?  But if I am not missing something, I don't recommend.",2
This is the best set of resistance bands on amazon at an amazing price. They offer great resistance and provide you with plenty of exercises that you can use these bands for.,2
Alot of bang  for the buck. Effective work out without the hassles of changing weight and buying expensive equipment. Best of all you can take it with you when traveling. It comes with a carrying case and has an instruction manual which clearly shows the different exercises and how to set up what is needed.,2
"Bought this for use while I was in physical therapy and am pretty happy with it for convenience factor.  It can be cumbersome, though, when having to switch out different bands over an hour or hour and a half of working with them.",2
Great bands! They  are strong and durable.  The door anchor is well constructed and easy to use.,2
"I looked at several similar sets of resistance bands, some boasted beautiful packaging and high quality materials for 10 or more dollars then this product. The packaging was basic and the carrying bag was mediocre,  but inside was a very high quaility and complete set. Exactly what I was hoping for when looking for a set, I also really appreciated the booklet on possible exercises and the thick foam handles; although one more set of handles so you could work with a partner would be nice. I really want to give 5 stars but couldn't,  the point off is for the conflicting information in the booklet. Inside the booklet it states the band's can be stretched 400%, even saying that translates to 1 foot of band can be stretched to 4 feet. Then in the back warnings section, in slightly smaller font it states to only stretch a maximum of 3 times total length. Just saying some clairification or a rewrite are in order. Although , if properly using the band's it seems unlikely anyone could even extend the band's that far. Thusly 4.5/5 stars if I could.",2
"Exceptional product! Better than I expected. With a history in the physical therapy industry, I would say these are one of the best resistance band sets I have come across. Great purchase!",2
The quality is good. They seem to do the job. A variety of exercises. I needed something to keep in shape and I didn't want any large equipment. This does the job.,2
"Very well made. Very easy to use I have several places in garage depending on height to use. I picked up a couple of heavy ""S"" hooks a hardware with them the garage door track is very handy. Nice assortment of weights. I have zero complaints on the quality and the speed of delivery.",2
"So far they work exactly like I expected.  The smaller ones are a little weaker then I expected but stretch very far.  You can add in multiple bands at the same time for various tensions.  The handles are comfortable and although I am not primarily using them attached to a door with the door attachment, it does work and stays put.",2
"I bought 2 sets of these so I could simultaneously work my left and right sides equally.  The quality is great.  I gave them four out of five because I would gladly give up having 5 slightly different resistances for an option to have duplicates or to be able to choose the 'colors' I want.  This is a VERY good product it's just that for my needs, I had to pay twice.",2
"I got these to replace my Bodylastics (BL) which I purchased from Amazon in 2010.  The Black Mountain set is 1/3 the price of my BL set, but the hardware is not as robust.  In addition, these bands are rated a lot higher in resistance weight than the BL.  In the BL set, I used the 8 lb band for arm exercises.  With this set I use the 25-30 lb band.  Feels the same.  So if you really want a resistant band for some more strenuous exercise, these are probably not for you.  You can double up on bands if you like, but that's not the point.  The BL had two attachments which allowed you to secure the band to a closed door and pull against it.  Very good for traveling.  This one requires hardware that needs to be mounted if you are going to use them in such a fashion.  The 25-30 lb band I use provides for smooth, not jerky motion.  I like that.  This has a lifetime warranty.  We'll see. Overall: they work.  Good for light workout. On Second Thought: I couldn't figure out why I had ordered a set of bands that required metal brackets for a door.  If you've ever used a set of metal brackets on a door, say to just hang clothes, you know that they: 1) scar the door; 2) usually prevent closing; 3) scar the door frame.  So I rechecked the product display on Amazon only to find out that the bands were supposed to come with a cloth door anchor.  Instead, they substituted the metal brackets.  I returned the whole set.  The cloth door anchor does not mar and permits you to use the bands on trips.",2
"I have been using these for the last 10 months without any issues. I do not like how the clips have started to rust, but that is my fault for not wiping and cleaning my sweat off a workout. The most important thing for me is that they do not abruptly snap during a workout and lash me like a peasant.",2
They work great. No problems thus far after a month of using them several times a week.,2
"This works really well....  At least it does when I use  ;-)  , Oddly it doesn't seem to work at when I leave it just sitting on my ottoman.",2
"These are great, this is actually my second set.  I bought my first set a couple years ago.  The price to quality ratio is very high in the favor of the consumer both at regular price point and the sale price point.  Overall, great product, well made.",2
"Great product, I use it every day. Very convenient and the stack-ability is great.",2
"This is one of the nicest workout equipment I got! I've been using these for about a year and a half, and they still work fantastic. The handles at the ends are able to rotate, which could be good or bad, depending on whether you want to workout your wrist, but I like it because it is appropriate for resistance bands. It comes with the bag as shown, so you are able to conveniently store it or carry it around. I haven't used the ankle strap much, but it is secure. I like doing bicep lifts with these, and I notice the results more quickly than using traditional weights. However, it won't help with lifting weights, as weights require you to use your wrist as well, which you don't get much wrist workout with these. I use them in addition to lifting weights.",2
Very nice set! I was looking for something that included ankle wraps and wasn't so limited on weight. This was perfect. I'm an avid gym goer but love this set for home use.,2
Well made products and would definitely order again. Not at all flimsy and metal pieces are sturdy. Yay!,2
"I wanted to try resistance bands to supplement my dumbbell workout. Looked at some different brands, and purchased these because of the positive reviews. Upon opening the package, it was immediately clear that these were very high-quality. They are actually much better than I expected. Professional gym quality - definitely heavy duty. I also love the fact that you can combine the different bands to increase the weight/resistance. Great company that obviously puts pride in the products they sell. Highly recommended!",2
Great set of bands.  Quite durable.  I've bought two sets over the years.,2
I'm a personal trainer and I use this set to help strengthen clients. It's a great purchase!,2
So far so good. I used it for P90 (the newer version) and it did what I needed it for.,2
Great product and very good quality.  This set is great for all family members.  Kids also get  a great workout with these.  Its fun and exercise at the same time.,2
"Excellent durable bands! Great for pull up simulation, really get you're strength up.",2
Very easy to use. Great resistance and the stacking capability is simple and quick to add or remove resistance. Great quality product.,2
"Easy to use, equipment seems durable enough to be stepped on and stretched.  This kit is good for beginner to mid-intermediary fitness level.  I'm a 135 pound woman who lifts at the gym 3-4 times a week.  This would be a helpful kit when traveling and there's no gym for a mild warm up.  I would not count on using these resistance levels for folks who are more advanced.  You may have to purchase supplemental bands that have higher resistance for more of a workout.",2
"update: have to come back to reiterate the outstanding customer service behind this quality product. I had to go back to them for more help on the product. Their response is helpful, quick and solution oriented. Great experience, highly recommend! >> I recently had cervical spine surgery and my Physical Therapist recommended resistance bands. I ordered these and could not be happier about the quality. I reached out to them with some questions and their service is excellent. Great quality bands and I love working out with them. I a traditional gym rat who works out with heavy weights. However, after using this for several months, I will keep them in my routine for the long term.",2
I have had these for two now and I love them. The bands are well made they feel like they will last a long time. They handles feel great in my hands. I would recommend this produce to anyone who is looking to work at home.,2
I am using this set at home for physical therapy and it works great.,2
"I've only scratched the surface of what I can do with these and I already love them. I've been working out, trying to lose weight, and these are a great addition to my routine. (I'm also using an indoor cycle and counting calories.) My only real complaint is that I hemmed and hawed on buying them for almost a month while I read reviews and price checked.",2
"Has all the bands one would need to tone up and rehab any injury's, without re-injuring yourself. Also you can take it with you when on the road and always have something to use for a quick workout",2
"This is a great set of resistance bands. This comes with everything you will need! I had shoulder surgery in Feb. and have been going to physical therapy twice a week since then. As some of you may Know PT is great but the work doesn't stop there you must do at home exercises as well. I bought these for just that reason they have helped me emulate some of the exercises we do during my PT visits. Now as for quality and value 5 stars. These bands are great quality, the handles are padded nicely and there modular design is very convenient. in comparison to some of the sets I have seen in stores and online you can not beat the value of this set. I wanted to wait a few day using these to give a review and I will say I would absolutely suggest you buy this set.",2
"Great product and exactly what you would expect.  Simple, and yet extremely helpful",2
Handy bag to carry all this stuff in it.  It is nice to be able to choose resistance according to one's strength.  I bought them and use the strength bands for both balance and strength in general.  Nice sturdy bag and very sturdy equipment in it as well.,2
Quality materials and great construction. These are not the cheap bands that start to shred and crack as they age.,2
"Ordered this set a couple weeks back and my wife and I both love this set to supplement our weight training.  Would give 5 stars if BMP made a fore foot cover with attached D ring for dorsiflexion (calf raises), but or now the ankle strap will suffice.  Very well made and the carabiners are very handy for quick changes.",2
"Great quality, easy to use, and convenient packaging with the bag. I travel a lot so this is great for keeping in shape during the days I can't get to a gym and lift!",2
Very well built . I have large hands and was concerned about the handles but was pleasantly surprised to find the handles are comfortable and strong. The door strap is well thought out. It's wide with a number of large hard plastic/rubber stoppers inside the strap pouch that can be adjusted to fit any door opening without fear of damaging the door or having it let loose. With the assortment of bands provided in the kit you will have all you need for a great workout routine,2
Awesome products. Works great! my wife and I use them constantly and they have no issues. I believe they have a lifetime warranty on the bands if they break so thats a plus!,2
"Just got it! Tried the strength of the bands, I pretty much much won't be using the yellow and blue, it's very light and seems it will rip off own you and I'm scared of that. The booklet got exercises for chest, back, biceps, triceps, calf and abs!",2
great product .. wonderful way to work out for strength training .. wonderful for someone who travels a lot ...,2
This product is so nice to have while at work. I work a desk job and sitting sedentary all day long is horrible for the health. Just this small amount of exercise gets the blood flowing and livens you up a little bit. Varying weights and high quality material makes this a great buy.,2
"Love these things. I'm 6'1"" 235 lbs and lift pretty seriously and these provide plenty of resistance. Easy to pack for travel as well.",2
Easy to use and quick set up.  So far working great.,2
"I love these exercise bands.  The possible variations of workouts is almost endless, considering how you can use multiple bands at the same time to add/ lessen resistance.  Also, the carry-bag they come in makes travelling with these bands, so easy!!  Meaning you can always have them with you when travelling, allowing you to at a minimum get a decent workout in, even when living in a hotel room.  I'm very happy with the purchase.",2
Good set of of bands. Easy to up or lower the resistance. Comfortable handles and good quality. Lots of options for resistance and they all fit nicely in a convenient carry case. I don't have a lot of space and these bands are a great addition to my work out equipment. I use them on a fairly regular basis.,2
"These resistance bands work perfectly as a 'travelling' gym. Admittedly I have so far only used the black, strongest band, but am experimenting with combinations. You will want to put the door anchor on the hinge side of the door.",2
"These are the best resistance bands I have ever used. Handles are wide, foam padded and comfortable. Door anchor is great and expands the routine greatly. Interchangeability of bands/weight/resistance is fast and easy due to the clip setup. Allows for speedy transitions to each exercise.",2
Great for exercising at a very cheap price. Come with their own bag.,2
"They get the job done. The resistance on the thicker bands aren't has heavy as I was looking for, but they work for under the foot workouts. Not the best for over the door work outs.",2
"Work good so far. Did hear a bit of a tear but, i haven't accidentally punched myself in the face yet.",2
"Really great product that comes with a lot of accessories such as a carrying bag and door anchor. I purchased this item for the p90x program that I've started and it was definitely a great purchase. Most of the exercises you do in p90x can be done with resistance bands with the exception of pull ups, but alternatives have been made possible because of the door anchors. These resistance bands can be pulled to great lengths without feeling like its going to snap on you. They snap on to the handles which makes interchanging between these bands extremely easy. One thing I do notice is that it seems to deteriorate in color the longer you use it, hopefully it doesn't snap on me one day and hit me in the face.  [...]",2
"quit your gym membership, wow I regret not buying this sooner.",2
This set has enough elastic resistance bands to keep you busy for awhile. It seems to be a great little set.,2
"use this with my home gym (bench, squat rack and dip/pullup station) to add resistance or reduce resistance (you can use it to help or hinder your resistance levels)... works great.",2
"This is the second time I purchased this set. We are a military family and it never fails that every time we move, the movers lose something. They lost a couple pieces to this kit this time around so I ended up ordering another since I liked it so much. I like P90X but have to modify a few of the exercises. I use this set for those modifications. I love that I can shut it in a door and use that instead of buying some huge contraption to make things work for me. Lots of options and quality with this set. :)",2
"This is a very nice, complete set of exercise bands. I actually searched for something like this in a couple of local sporting goods stores, but they either sold the bands and handles separately or had a kit with far fewer options at a much higher price. I like how you can double-up bands for increased resistance with this set, plus the door adapter and ankle attachment are a nice added bonus. So is the storage bag. So if you're looking for a versatile set of exercise bands, I highly recommend this Black Mountain product.",2
"I purchased these resistance bands after going through PT for my right shoulder which was diagnosed with tendinitis. The PT gave me both stretches and band exercises to do, and these bands have really made all the difference. I was given a few of those flat elastic bands by the PT, but they quickly gave out, while the Black Mountain Bands have lasted a full year of use 2-3 times a week. Using these bands has brought my shoulder from being painful to move without any external load to being able to do pull-ups, rock climb, and play squash completely pain free. The handles are comfortable and make it easier to pull with more force, and the door jam strap gives me confidence that the bands won't come loose. The bands do show some wear in the middle where they come in contact with the door jam, but it's not surprising given the friction and I'm counting on the lifetime warranty in case it does break.",2
Exactly what I was looking for.  Everything you need and the bands seem very durable.,2
Love my new band's.  The handles are good and wide for a easy grip . Love  the different options. The door thingy  any ways great for the money.  Will get plenty of use out of this.,2
These bands are excellent and so is the customer service who replaced a band with 8 months of usage that had some minor wear on the band itself.  I use these bands regularly and they have held up well.  I even bought a second set for the office as they are so portable.  I also purchased a second set of handles and the Velcro straps for working the legs.  All Black Mountain products I have purchased have been very high quality.  I highly recommend their products.,2
Great product..Super Company...BMP bands are so much better than other cheaper ones. Love the easy on and off handles.  A+A+A+A+,2
"These are great!  They're easy to take anywhere, and you can get a decent workout on the go.  When I use them regularly, I can see a difference in my swim stroke.",2
"The tubes are thin. Although you receive 5 tubes, the wall thickness is very thin and flimsy making them very week. The door anchor is tiny and the handles seem very cheap and plastic. The picture looks impressive but the actual product under delivers.",2
Great resistance bands for the price.  I've used them several times a week for over a year and they all work just as well as when I bought them.,2
LOVE this set! It has everything you need for a great strength training workout.,2
"Purchase for our home gym, both me and my husband use this product.",2
Excellent product! Most comprehensive resistance band system I have found! Very durable construction!,2
"Seller: 5 Stars Product Quality: 5 Stars  Awesome! you not only have a good quality tubing but also a variety of them you can use to suit your needs! for example I can use the heaviest one for most of the exercises (I'm an athlete), but for some exercises you need the tubing to be pre-stretched and it's very difficult to do it with the heaviest one, so you have four others to choose from!",2
"I've had the bands for over 3 weeks and they're absolutely perfect!  The door anchor won't damage your door, and it works great  I use them 2-4 days per week and they show no signs of wear at all. The carabiners make it easy to switch between bands quickly, give you the ability to use multiple bands, and provide a secure attachment to the grips.  The carrying bag is a nice addition as well.",2
"There are well-made and come with all of the accessories you need.  I use them with P90X3 when traveling both for curls as well as the door attachment for modifying the chin-up routines.  The grips and attachments seem really solid, so no concerns about a ""blow out"" like I had with the band that came with my P90X3 kit.  It's nice to be able to combine the different bands to achieve resistance beyond the thickest band.  The travel pouch is nice, but I usually travel with just the bands I need tossed into my backpack.  I can't think of any reason to deduct a star - not high tech, but they do what they're designed to do.",2
"Wow!  Just what I was looking for!  I just got these resistance bands in the mail and tested them out for a bit. The quality appears to be fantastic and the price is right! I'm a student and the gyms in my area are too far and too expensive. These bands seem to do the trick. They are cost effective and from my limited use seem to give you the experience of working out on a machine (or should I say, the experience of working out on multiple machines depending on the configuration you choose).  I've only had them for a few hours, but I'm already in love. If you can't make it to the gym these bands are PERFECT!  In the time it takes to get to the gym your workout can already be over. Plus, they aren't limited to one location like an expensive machine is. Anywhere there's a door, there's a workout. As I mentioned I'm currently a student, but if you work in an office without a gym on site these would be PERFECT! You could easily set them up and get a good workout during lunch. The bag they come in is compact and light, so when you buy these bands you have NO EXCUSES not to get a good workout.  I'm trusting the other users that these will last a long time--which looking at the quality appears to be true. They seem well-built. Even if they broke after a year I would certainly buy these again. Just way to easy and convenient to be without!  Why the motto for this product isn't ""If you have a door--You have a workout!"" is beyond me.",2
"This is a nice set of resistance bands that appear to be made to last.  These are much different and of better quality than the bands you'll find in certain stores.  The metal hooks work extremely well and you don't have to worry about them breaking in the middle of using them, and the handles also appear to be made for the long run. I've used these now for several workouts doing things like face pulls, wood chops, pallof presses and more, and they haven't seemed to lose their shape at all.",2
These are good quality. It's good that they come with a bag to hold everything. Even comes with a book that shows various exercises you can do with them. I would definitely recommend these for anyone looking for resistance bands,2
"Take some time to learn the basics, other than that seems to work OK.",2
"Bought to use over seas,  they got used allot and stretched to their max...  Very happy",2
"These resistance bands are great! They do exactly what they're supposed to do.  Although I use gloves, the handles are comfortable without the gloves. I really get a great workout, especially when I follow the exercises included with the bands.  I love that the bands come in a small, washable bag.",2
Bought after 3months in physical therapy for shoulder. Use everyday at home. Comes with great instructions and exercises.,2
Not crazy about these. Not as much of a workout as you'd hope.,2
"These work pretty well, with some caveats. My main purpose was to do leg curls at home, which work well with the ankle attachment. The issue is that the stated resistance levels are very optimistic. I can one-leg curl with every single band attached. So, I had to purchase additional bands which is disappointing.  I did try some triceps push downs, which were only marginally effective. Because of the length of the bands, I had to stand quite far from the door - and even then, really wasn't able to perform an efficient exercise through the full range of motion. I suppose that if I had a super high doorframe, this might have been less of an issue.  So, three stars because with enough bands, they do work for single leg curls - which meet my needs. I'm just glad that I don't need them for any other exercises.",2
"Product works excellent. Motivation is the hard part. Packalbe- yes Tough enough for a guy's strong causal work out- yes Could Arnold, in his prime, use these- as dental floss, yes Just do your research on different work outs to do with them and its going to be worth it",2
Bands are great.  The handles wear on the strap that holds the ring and fray them to the breaking point.,2
"I've only had this for 2 days, but I think I can safley say its an AMAZING kit.  Couldn't ask for anything more.  Saved me a ton vs. local sporting goods big name stores.",2
"If you are on the go and are looking to get a good workout in, This is the band kit for you!  The clipping system for adding the resistance band is excellent.  You can get up to about 175 lbs of total resistance. It comes with a door mount so you can mount the resistance bands on a door way to get many additional exercises.  It also has the ankle attachment so you can work your legs mainly the adductors and abductors. While I was skeptical at first, you can really develop a good workout that will work the entire body.  The book it comes with shows you many.  Also I have found many YouTube videos on using bands in workouts.  Band for your exercise buck, you can't go wrong with this kit!",2
Great for the price.  They work great.  Fast shipping.  I recommend them. I have been using them for over 6 months.  Still in good condition.,2
Just as described.  perfect for my PT routine for my shoulder.  easy to take with you on the road as well.  So far very durable.  I would recommend this to anyone for the price.,2
"I bought these bands for use as a training device. They are still new so I will have to wait to report on their durability and longevity, but they appear very sturdy. The bands are ""weighted"" by color and the booklet has their listed weight estimates. The weight of the resistance can change dramatically depending on how far you stretch it. Example: overhead press puts much more ""weight"" into the band than say a curl might. This gives a similar effect to squatting with a chain. The intensity increases further into the movement. The insertion point of the band into the nylon/hook area is very well manufactured. It has a knot, wrapped in a rubber sleeve, that has been inserted through an eyelet. The clips are strong carabiners and are not hooked to the bands in any way, they are hooked to the nylon. The handles are foam, not rubber, grips, so I assume the normal wear and tear from a foam handle, but they are not, in any way, flimsy. The system works very simply to clip in and out for varying resistance. It's a quick and easy change when you move between exercises. When I had mine in the door frame, I kept all the bands hanging and only clipped the ones I needed. It worked great so my boyfriend and I could swap out between sets without any fuss. The door anchor is decent; I have seen more secure versions but I still don't imagine this will be a problem. The anchor is smaller than what I'm used to seeing (I have always seen the ""tube"" style anchors, this one is a few small... things... inside the nylon) but it seems to work just fine. The anchor can go over the door, or on the hinge side of the door to adjust for height. Both these methods work great and are simple to set up. The ankle strap is soft and comfortable with a sturdy D ring to clip to the bands. The total system is small, lightweight, and incredibly versatile. Aside from being great just to have in your home or small apartment, they would be great for personal trainers who do in-home training, physical therapists, or the fitness minded person who likes/needs to travel; just throw it in your suitcase and go. I got a great workout from these bands and they offer resistance in a way that weights do not. Similar to working out with TRX... the moves may be the same, but the muscles it works may be different, or the same muscles may be worked in a different way. This is a great addition to any gym. I don't know what took me so long to get a set. I'm very happy with the system, the product, and the customer service (I called to talk with CS to ask them about a promotion they had noted in the paperwork. They were so nice. No sales pitches, no pushy reps, and no gimmicks, just a really nice guy who answered my questions, and was very friendly and informative).",2
"I like the quality of the bands, and they combine well to put in a range of resistance.  However, the handles are a pretty cheap, brittle plastic.  One of the handles shattered while I was using heavy resistance.  I pulled out the pieces and tried to use the strap only, but it has something stitched in the middle, and hurts the palm of my hand.  So not very satisfied with this.",2
Perfect for the home gym. The resistance bands could basically be a Bowflex unit if you YouTube how to set things up. I've really put them through their paces and they work great.,2
These are amazing! I love being able to travel so easily with them. I can work out anywhere now.,2
"Just received my resistance bands a few days ago, and must say I'm pretty impressed. I like must buyers read the product reviews before making my purchase, and after reading one particular review where the bracket snapped in half and cut the persons foot I must admit I had my concerns. So I ""rolled the dice"" anyway based on price/value and the overwhelming positive reviews. As soon as my package came I opened it expecting to find those poor quality brackets but was shocked to find something else. It actually shipped with some nice decent quality carabiners instead of the snap on brackets. It reassured me that BMP cares about their products and pays attention to their reviews.",2
"I really love these resistance bands! Once I got them I put them to work immediately. They are pretty sturdy and adjustable, I use it everyday and i have no complaints so far. As far as I'm concern this was a good buy!!",2
"Great product. Being disabled with chronic pain,leg and back issues there's not much I can do workout wise. Even walking can be unbearable so looking for something I could do at home whenever I feel up to it I tried these resistance bands. Managed to lose 6 lbs using them about 10 - 15 minutes a day for a month. May not sound like much but considering some fat also went to muscle as well and I'm feeling much better getting some workout time in daily it's a lot to me. Want to get buff or drop 200 lbs overnight these aren't what your looking for. Want to lose some weight,build up some muscle with a low impact,easy to do and set your own pace workout than this is what you need! These are a high quality product that should last a long time with daily use.",2
"Post surgery recovery, using these to rebuild some strength.  Working out great so far, just make sure to hold on tight or you could poke an eye out.",2
"This is a surprisingly good system.  Quick to switch between and gives you a good workout.  Lots of exercises if you're creative and they seem very sturdy.  I've had them for about a year and my whole family uses them.  No sign of wear or breakage.  Love using resistance over weights as it reduces likelihood of injury.  Nice complement to home gym and easy to bring on the road.  Oh, and everything actually fits in the bag like it's supposed to!",2
good product and performs as expected but I realized after the fact that I should of bought bands with more resistance,2
A great value for what you get.  Better than other branded bands.,2
"I priced these at a lot of local stores and other Amazon vendors.  This was by far the best deal.  The cords are good and sturdy, connections and accessories work well and all zip into a bag you can toss somewhere.",2
Good quality bands.  I use them often and they seem to hold up just fine.,2
I LOVE these! Very easy to use and set up. I like that it comes with a few exercise suggestions.,2
Purchased these to go with P90 as they are about half the price of Beach Body's resistance bands.  I have had mine for about a month and have had no problems at all.  Very well made and the materials used seem to be first rate.  They are holding up very well.  I would recommend these if you are looking for good quality bands at a great price.,2
"These resistance bands are nice, but wish they were shorter for what I wanted to use them for. I finally figured out what the black plain piece was for, to stick in a door, in order to use bands that way. I am mainly using the stronger black band with handles and red one to stretch, just using my hands. I guess I need two more handles. I really wanted the chair gym months ago, but HSN would take too long to ship it. The other three bands are okay to stretch together. The ankle strap is okay if you find the right place to use it. The directions do tell you not to wrap straps around any part of body, but I did it anyway. Sometimes you get tired of using the door! The metal hooks along with cloth piece attached to them are nice also, but cloth fits more comfortably having it hang from the larger part of hook.",2
"As a Personal Trainer (and a customer) I'm happy with these Resistance Bands.  As a Personal Trainer:  When you're using Resistance Bands you're demonstrating a type of training called ""Dynamic Resistance Training.""  This refers to the fact that throughout the entire movement resistance is being applied to the muscle that is being worked.  A Biceps Curl is a perfect example.  When using a resistance band for a biceps curl at the top of the movement (meaning when your arm is up towards your shoulder) there is still resistance being placed on the muscle because of the elasticity of the band.  If you were doing the same biceps curl with a standard free weight barbell, at the top of the movement there is little to no resistance being placed on the muscle.  This is the beauty of Dynamic Resistance Training. The muscle is being placed under constant tension.  At some point you may find that there is not enough resistance when using any one individual band, but no worries!  Just combine a couple of bands to increase the resistance!  As a Customer: I like having a set of bands around for when I can't get to the gym or I am traveling.  Everything easily fits in the bag that is included and they are compact.  It's very easy to switch positioning or add bands thanks to the quick release clips. I enjoy using bands with handles versus the therapy bands that are used by Physical Therapists or Yoga instructors.  Those tend to pinch the skin, and it's definitely harder to get a good workout in!  These bands almost feel the same as working out in the gym with the cable machine.",2
My son uses these often.  There are some other brands selling for 4-5 times the price.  I cannot see any real difference and have held both sets in my hands,2
"I am very impressed. It is cool that you can have a full body workout in such a small package. These would be fantastic for those who like to workout when they are traveling, and for folks like us that have a very small house and can't fit in a lot of bulky equipment. I have no complaints. I love the door anchor that allows you to do chest and back exercises. This was money well spent. I recommended a set to my parents, and they love it too!",2
"Goodbye gym!  There are multitudes of videos in You Tube for workouts.  With guide, it all fits in a little bag!  So cool.  Great workouts available without weights.  Just resistance!",2
"Horrible! Made of what can only be described as cheap, substandard material, do not buy these if you plan to use them regularly.  My wife used these 1 to 2 times per week since we bought them in June 2014.  The green and blue straps broke after only 10 months of use.  After 2 months, we noticed that the rubber had begun to deteriorate on all of the bands.  I will never Black Mountain Products resistance bands again.",2
very nice package with lots of options. would prefer a workout dvd with it. i emailed customer support about another issue and i have not heard back in a week yet.,2
"Bought these for my travels. They're easy to carry but I'm giving this three stars because the bands are not as resistant as they claim to be. I'm using a combination of black and red for chest (allegedly equals 40-50 lbs) and red and yellow for triceps (allegedly 27-34 lbs), and I can hardly feel any pain in my muscles. Nothing. And I usually suffer with anything above 10lbs because the truth is I haven't worked out in more than 10 years and barely started last week. I've been on a diet before this, went from 210lbs to 165lbs. No creatine, no steroids, no supplements other than my protein shake as a replacement meal on certain meals. I've seen skinny girls at the gym who could lift more weight than I did.  So, in short, I'm not exactly athletic, and these were way too easy for me. Will probably use them for a bit until I find something stronger.",2
I have been very pleased with this set of bands. Confident in strength of bands and a nice kit. Just ordered extra handles to move from floor exercises to door exercises using different strength bands.,2
These guys make a great product - and putting all this in one affordable package is AWESOME! The handles are pretty decent quality and it is cool that you can stack them - put 2-3 together at one time for increased resistance!  Good Stuff!,2
"I was a little skeptical seeing the price of these, but I was really surprised with the quality of the whole kit. Nothing feels like it will break, and it all stows away in its case, which is perfect for living in a cramped apartment. The handles rotated easily, and it is ridiculously easy to setup for your next exercise. I'm 5'10"", and it didn't feel like it was over stretching when standing on the bands. Pros -Great for small places like apartments where a machine isn't feasible to own -Good value -Comes with workout card to show you all the exercises you can do Cons -While everything feels durable and well built, it will take time to see how long the bands last, but you can't really count it as a con Will update after more time spent with this kit!",2
I have used these several times so far and they work very well. I have had no problems at all and I suspect these will last years if they are not abused. All the colors arrived as well as the accessories. Looking forward to furthering my strength with these.,2
The bands are really sturdy and do the job. I use them with my P90X3 discs and they have great resistance to them. I love that you can just add the handles to each band with the clips.,2
"Worked for a little it then started to wear away and developed holes in the after about 6 months of regular use in addition to weights. No longer use them in fear of them snapping. I'd spend the extra money and buy the thicker, more durable bands like I ended up doing after these wore out like- Lifeline PRO Resistance Trainer Kit",2
"UPDATE: After 18 months, the black band is finally ready to snap in half.  Time to order new ones.  I will look for something more durable.  I guess you get what you pay for.  I rarely have used these -- they just seem to get bad with age, which makes sense for essentially giant rubber bands eh?  Maybe this is the way it is with bands, but it gives me pause as I think about life on the road depending on these things for my workouts.  ORIGINAL REVIEW:  The thing I like best about these is the clip system -- bands are easy to add/subtract.  I hate the type you have to pull the bad through with much effort.  These just clip on easily and you can use multiple bands at a time with handles.  Very versatile, and lightweight.",2
Perfect!!!  Just what I was looking for.  Awesome product at a great price!!!,2
Easily set up and allows this senior to exercise upper body some at home.,2
I ordered the bands because they are similar to the ones I am using in physical therapy.  I was happily surprised that they actually appear to be higher quality that the ones I am using in the office.  I also considered some carried at big box stores and they were single or double band slotted handles while these are simple hooks.  They are simple enough that my 9 yr old can swap out the band for exercise.,2
"I got it because my physical therapist recommended it - they have it in their office, it's held up really well, and I use mine every day with good results - the gadget to attach it to the door really works, the handles are convenient.  Very nice.",2
"I don't know what more to say than this is an absolutely sound product. It's durable and has met all expectations. My only complaint is that they don't have stronger bands, but I've counteracted that by just using multiple bands at once. A fantastic piece of equipment to have a home for those that can't afford a gym membership!",2
Great product. My whole family use them. Very satisfied specially at that price,2
Just as described and I love the handles so I can switch or add pounds.,2
"In the spirit of openness it should be noted that Black Mountain awards those who leave reviews with an additional band. That said, these are exactly what I was hoping for: heavy duty, well made, and complete. I may buy another set for my son.",2
"These bands are working great for me. Can get a good workout without lots of heavy, room filling equipment. There customer service has been great.",2
Great bands. I use them for P90x. They do the job.,2
"Use it pretty much everyday. However, the lower two bands yellow and blue seem to loose its elasticity and resistance. Shipped on time.",2
"What a deal! I have began building a small home gym. These bands are the perfect addition. They come in a great little travel bag, all ready to go. The instructions include the ""pounds"" or resistance of each colored band. You switch them out with the carabiners to the handles provided. I've used them for a week or so now and they are really great. Easy to use. Love them!",2
"Love these bands, they are very well made.  I can see me using them for many years to come.",2
I love these bands.. They are very strong and do not snap.. I am up the 25lb resistance using them in different positions is giving me a great workout.. They come with a loop that is closed in door jam i use on top of door to pull down and out great arm workouts.. Use in lower side jam to do rows.. Very happy with this product!!!,2
These bands are perfect for what I needed it for.  Loved the fact that you could change the bands to make it convenient if you want to use more than one band at a time.  Bands are solid and of high quality.  Highly recommended.,2
"Well made and portable, just what I need to do therapy at home. I like how things can be put together and anchored so easily. Will write more after using more frequently.",2
"These are well made and the kit is a good deal. It comes with a set of stackable bands, the handles, door anchor and ankle strap. Aside from stretching and light work most will have to add bands to this kit. I added a purple (40-50lbs) and the atomic green (70-75lbs). I use my kit to workout when I am on the road. They yellow and blue bands are useless to me, but buying outside of the kit is more expensive. I have about $60 all into this kit and it allows me to work my chest, arms, shoulders, back, do ""weighted"" squats and all the major muscle groups. I add in some planks for core and jumping jacks to get my heart rate up and it is a great workout that can be thrown in a bag, taken and done about anywhere.",2
cost was fantastic. the bag is nice to store these in. i like that you can clip many of the bands to the handles. i use these while binge watching shows on netflix. arrived very quickly.,2
Enjoyed these resistance bands. Very good value for the price. Easy to set up and easy to reproduce the exercises in the accompanying booklet. Likely the best value resistance bands on the market.,2
"This is so handy to have, easy to use, great resistance.  Gives additional elements to home work out and therapy.",2
"Bought this for physical therapy after a collarbone injury. I really like them though and hope to use it as a home gym and strengthening my shoulders which are prone to all kinds of injury. Great for the price with all the attachments and different levels of resistance, with comfortable handles and seems rugged enough after many uses. I also bought a book on resistance band exercises which has helped me to utilize this set to a fuller potential which I recommend too.",2
These bands are great especially if you aren't in perfect shape,2
"So far these are working out great.  I like working out and I enjoy it more at home because I am in school.  These allow for flexibility, and the ability to do many different things with a short amount of time and without a bunch of equipment.",2
I actually really like these bands. I haven't used them a ton yet but they seem well made and work well. I did try the door anchor and used it without any issue. So far I'm very pleased with this purchase.,2
These are great set of resistance bands. I have used this almost every day since receiving them. They are of good quality and have many different types of uses. This set comes with everything you need to get started and with a great direction sheet to help with of use of the bands.,2
Happy with the quality of this kit. The bands seem as if they will last a long time and the added bag and handles/mounts are a huge bonus in my book.,2
"I purchased these directly from Black Mountain, they were a little cheaper and I got free shipping.  I have been using them now for a few weeks and they seem to be pretty good.  I love the fact that it comes with the piece for the door and your ankle.  I also love the fact that I can grow into them.  The lowest weight did nothing for me, but I added the next weight up with that one and have a good workout going.  These are worth the price, in fact they are much more reasonably priced then all the ones I saw in the store, not to mention they stand behind their product.  Now let's see if I can keep it up!",2
"I am 5'6"" and I feel limited on how I can use these because of how long they are... I'm sure my husband who is 6'4"" won't have any problem using them in whatever way he wants but I am definitely disappointed in the long length and I think if it is stretchy then why make the length so long.",2
I really like this set and it packs well in luggage. I just wish I had the discipline to use them as often as I should!,2
"Just what I needed to get the cardiologist off my back, toning upper body and now the doctor and I are very happy",2
"It is a good set and gets the job done. One note if you want to do bicep work, there is only one band of each weight class. You will need two sets if you wish to do exercises independent  of each arm.",2
I love these bands  - I use them for a lot of different exercises and my husband uses them for his physical therapy.  they are very well made.  I love that the come with the little storage bag,2
Great stuff! I love to pack this when I go somewhere else and need to work out. great for the price you won't be sorry.,2
This a great set of bands. I really like the ability to swap in and out different bands to create the ideal tension I'm looking for. The quality of the bands and the handle feel great! All said these bands are a great value for the money.,2
works great and has lasted years. my wife and I are very happy,2
Nice complement to the P90X3 workout.  Easy to transport when traveling.  Very easy to switch between bands.  We bought extra handles so that we can work out at the same time.,2
"For my family who have alot of problems ranging from Rheumatism, Fibromyalgia, and lots of back problems this has come as a blessing for us.  Normal weights cause to much stress on our bodies and these give you a workout twice as fast, with less impact.  It has worked great for my family and would defintely order another set in the future!  Black Mountain sells some great stuff!6",2
"Wonderful set, a great addition to my home workout routine, easy to store and awesome quality... wish there were four handles instead of two because sometimes I work out with a partner and we have to take turns with these.",2
Only used for about a week but so far it seems good quality and very useful for at home use.  Only gave four stars as I will update later to see how well they maintain their strength.,2
"Best resistance bands ever! Makes exercise fun.  My bands came with metal clips to attach the grip to the band itself, they seem really sturdy and haven't shown any signs of wear.",2
Nice little set.  Not sure about having to post a review to get the free Orange band offer though.  I don't like trading reviews for incentives - I think that skews reviews in favor of products.,2
I haven't used these on a daily basis because I like to switch up my workouts but I have zero regrets! Every time I use these I'm not in fear of the bands snapping. They are extremely durable and the handles are super comfy. I love how you can quickly go from one band to the next with the quick connect. I'm a little skiddish about using the door mount just because I'm phobic about it coming back and snapping me in the face but besides that this was a great buy! Everything fits beautifully back into the the bag after my workout and stores nicely on the shelf!,2
"Love these. Been using them 2 year now. A few broke because I absolutely used the hell out of them, but the company replaced them with no issues. Great company. Great bands. Great price.",2
"These resistance bands work well, come in a handy carry bag, and have well built attachments. Good Purchase.",2
Good quality product. Have been using for about a year now so bought a set for a family member. Everything you need for a complete workout.,2
"They work well and are easy to use, a bit annoyed I have to call for the orange one so they lose a star for that!",2
"We have been very happy with this product, using it for P90X workouts at home.  The quality is very good relative to other similar products we have seen, particularly in the stability and manufacturing in the carabiners that attach the bands to the handles.  Less expensive varieties often use very thin metal here to save cost at the expense of durability and function.  This sets also contains more bands than less expensive sets, including a black band for maximum resistance.  The only thing that could be improved would be the addition of one of those foam donuts on a strap that lets you fix the straps to a doorframe by wedging it between the door and the doorjamb.  Fortunately we had one of these from a previous pack of bands so it wasn't a problem, but if we hadn't had that we would have been out of luck for this type of exercise.",2
Bought because my brother recommended.  I'd been looking for a good set of resistance bands to add to my home gym.  This set was inexpensive and you get a lot for your money.  Would definitely recommend.  I bought this twice. The second was for a personal trainer friend of mine for his busines.  It's great for the casual work out or heavy duty pump.,2
"Great quality product! I'm a power lifter with a home gym... lots of free weights, a rack, and dip station (BMP of course). No room for a lat pull-down or other cable equipment. This product is perfect to replace that need.  The product itself is very well made and easy to use.  Would definitely recommend to a friend.",2
Let's just say there is a good reason why ( as of the date I am writing this ) there are about 2500 reviews with an average 4-5 star rating. For the price these are an unbelievable bargain. They are good quality and allow you to easily band together a few band without having to hold on to two sets of handles.,2
I really have enjoyed these bands since receiving them.  I have only had them for a few weeks I believe but I have used them very often.  They are well made and seem to be holding up quite well.  I like how the bands attach to the handles and/or ankle strap.  There are so many different types of exercises that you are able to do.  I did enjoy that it came with a range of different strength resistance bands but I would enjoy if more were included in the set as it would be nice to have more resistance for some exercises.  It would also be nice to have more than one ankle strap/cuff.  The bag included is a very nice thing to have to keep everything together and clean when not in use.  The product arrived on time and in good condition.  The company does a good job of presenting itself based on the quality of the product as I was unsure at first thought of purchase because I had not heard of the company previously.  I guess it may have been the logo that gave me an initial impression that it could be an inferior product but I was incorrect.  The company did a great job and I am excited to try another one of their products!  I will have to wait before I give everything the long term thumbs up but initial reviews are all headed in the right direction.,2
great value. can't beat the price. good set that will last awhile if you take care of it. recommended.,2
"Good for the price, highly recommended if you work out at home.",2
The bands came quickly and I was able to use them in a variety of different ways to with out mammy muscles in my body with the small booklet of exercises that came packaged with it as well as viewing exercises of the company web site. I gave up on my L.A. fitness membership for these. I recommend it.,2
"arrived fast and well packed, pretty nice little set for sure thanks.",2
These keep you right when can't find time to go hit the gym!,2
"I love it i feel the tension . am doing p90x 3 , and since i cant do pull ups , those were very effective and i can feel the burn i use the black and the red at the same time :) very happy with it , and its well made",2
"Great bands, using them as part of the P90X workout.  Don't know what else to say it gets the job done.",2
"Great product, but I am kind of terrified by how small the piece is that gets wedged in the door.  I can't help but flinch every time I use this because I feel like it's going to snap through the door jam and into my face.  Other than that, I would definitely recommend.",2
"Women over 40 years of age, this is it for weight bearing exercises. I am 52 and I am toned and fit without going to gym!",2
Returned item. Was thin and hard to use. Maybe I just don't know how to use these things but after 20 minutes of trying I gave up.,2
"I am well pleased with this set. By far the best complimentary band set (everything in this set compliments each item perfectly) I've seen or used. Very well built. Sturdy. (The stitching is well done and strong).The chrome fasteners on the tubes and ""D"" rings on the handles and ankle strap are strong and make for super-fast tube changing for tension adjustments. The door anchor is a fabulous addition, easy to use, well made and strong.  More importantly, this set is FUN. Having used conventional equipment (""weights"") off 'n on most of my life, I can assure YOU that with this set you will get a better and wider range of movement for every exercise typically executed with conventional weights. To enhance the experience and development, try doing your movements ""mindfully"" and slowly. The ""BURN"" is perfectly sweet!  Just as important for me is the convenience. Easily stored. You can take them anywhere.",2
"I especially like the portability of this product, very useful if you travel.  I would not take the lifetime warranty seriously since is it subject to change at any time, and I suppose anything that stretches will weaken with time, but at this price, if it lasts a few years, I will be satisfied",2
"I am very impressed with the quality of this product... all elements of it.  While attempting to put together an add-on not sold by Black Mountain, it was necessary for me to price out some of the parts.  I honestly do not see how they can sell a product of this quality for the price they are asking.  I also had occasion to call their customer service and found them to be helpful way beyond my expectations.  I need it for a rotator cuff injury and it is working out perfectly.  Five stars.",2
"For $30 this is a pretty comprehensive, well made set of bands and accessories to make them useful.  However, for my purposes I found the strongest band barely strong enough to get any benefit from exercising with it.  The other bands will never be used unless I find some alternative exercises that require less resistance.  This isn't a complaint about the product, it has more to do with an individual's needs.",2
"Excellent set of bands.  All of the connections are quality, and the individual components are sturdy.  The bands are distinctly graduated in resistance, with even the ""lightest"" being a great staring point for my rotator cuff rehabilitation.",2
"Use the setup on a closet door a couple times a week. I would like it if each band could be used with just one handle instead of both at the same time, but that is how they are designed and I could see that going in when purchased.",2
I was very pleased with quality and versatility of product.  Could not find one that would accomplish all this could/can do in local sports stores.  That is unless I purchased either single sets and at a much higher price.,2
"This set of bands is a lot more than you can get anywhere in the stores. After I test the durability, I will be able to say more. But right not, it seems like it can last.",2
Works well - very versatile and just as advertised.  My personal trainer integrate in my workouts and seems limitless in its use.,2
"I'm not a very strong person, but I was able to use all of the bands connected together and didn't feel adequate resistance from the bands. I also noticed the bands are too long for some of the exercises resulting in the need to anchor them on a door or exercise tower/apparatus. The quality seemed acceptable, but the bands left a slick residue on my carpeting just from handling the material.  Overall: 3/5 stars, not enough resistance from the bands - these seem like toys compared to the ones found at fitness centers.",2
I use this at station to get a low impact stretch and exorcise between 911's.  Has held up over a year now without signs of wear.,2
"Easy to use, light to pack while travelling and works as good as the gym.",2
I have only had mine for about a month but so far I really like them. I use them two to three times a week. You can make a wide range of resistance by adding different bands to your grips. Great for travel.,2
"i really like this, i use them almost everyday when i am at home, you can working out all your muscles with resistence bands, i have seen many videos already about, so easy and really work your body..... so good, good workout to do excercise without leave home...",2
"Love these bands. I have used these for the P90X program for a few years now and they work great. They just take a week or two to get used to them but they are very convenient to travel with. I have had them for about three years now and they haven't worn out or been damaged in any way.  Update on 9/15/15:After about 2 years, one of the bands snapped. Unfortunately, this is a band users nightmare come true. The band almost caused a serious injury. I do not feel safe when using this product now as a result",2
"Well made, great quality, the carabiners are metal. There was a free promotion flyer for a heavier band in the box. The bands high quality.",2
"I looked at a lot of resistance bands, and this kit for the money seemed like a really good deal.  The door hanger thing works great.  I haven't used the ankle strap, cause let's face it, my legs are legit as they are now.  I'd buy these again, but hopefully I won't have too.",2
Good set of resistance bands to have. The different resistances make it great for anyone to use.,2
"The items are just like you'd expect them to be.  They're functional and stores easily.  Customer service is great as well.  The ankle strap was missing and the red band had a tear in it.  An email and a couple days later, the ankle strap and red band arrived at my door.  Resistant bands are a nice alternative to weights, and if you're opting for resistant bands, you can't go wrong with bands.  Edit 1:  *Deducted a star*  The replacement red band seemed fine, but after using it for a total of 18 hours, cracks started to appear, lots of cracks.  I emailed customer service and they're sending another.  What bothered me was they recommended I use multiple bands instead of stretching the band to their limit.  LIMIT??!  I have only used it according to the provided guide.  The bands are 40"" long and are suppose to be able to stretch to 5 times that, which would be over 16 feet, roughly 3 times my height (5'8"").  Exaggerations about elasticity?  Quality control issues?  Perhaps I was unlucky?  Maybe I'm stretching it wrong?",2
I use this daily to do physical therapy exercises to strengthen my core. They are well made.,2
"The bands are color-coded for resistance level, making it easy to swap bands to obtain the exact resistance you want. The handles are sturdy and comfortable. I especially appreciate the metal carabiner-style clips that seem much stronger than the cheap plastic used in some other brands.",2
I love em. I had rubber band strips before. These are great for Me. Nice handles and You can set resistance to whatever You want. I've been using them every day.,2
Works great. And Black Mountain's customer service is awesome. One of my bands had a nick in it and they sent me one out right away free of charge and with no shipping fees.,2
This strap combo is great very good quality and I'm sure we will get hours of use out of it. Thanks,2
"I bought these with the idea that I could keep myself active in the office; working the mid shift to ""goodnight"" makes me feel sluggish. I didn't go wrong with these.  A good thing to have when you're feeling active or want to get the blood going instead of sitting for 8hrs +",2
"I am a fitness instructor and we picked up a class where we use these tubes/bands all of the time.  The ones provided by my facility are tough to gauge as far as strength and resistance goes.  I picked up this set and they have been working out very well.  Cris-crossing the handles can get them interlocked here and there, but now I have a good idea of what resistance I am working with for just about every class.",2
I bought this as a pull up alternative while traveling its not the most durable set out there but you get what you pay for and the price is right.,2
Excellent and cost-effective way to tone muscle anywhere without too much set up.,2
"The problem with elastic bands is that the resistance changes as the bad is stretched out.  Depending on what you use it for, this may not be a deal breaker.  For stretching and flexibility work it is ok, but if you intend to use it for strength building this is not the right tool for the job.",2
Great value for the $$$ and gives you a lot of options.,2
Really good product for the money.  Great customer service.  I use these bands 5 or 6 days a weeks.,2
"I've used the crap out of these for a few months and I love them. I purchased a few chrome hooks/bike hooks from home depot and placed them in various locations on the wall of my garage. Basically, I now have a bowflex that just mounts on the wall and you can just leave all the stuff hanging off of the hooks for next time. BOOM",2
"I've been using this for a couple of months.  So far, so good.  I haven't had any quality control problems: no ripping or tearing.  The bands are crisp, and handles are well made and comfortable.  This is my first time using bands.  I have a few hundred dollars worth of free weights sitting in my basement collecting dust because--even though I prefer free weights--it is difficult for me to juggle my family commitments if I'm sitting in my basement.  I also don't want to bring my free weights upstairs because have a feeling my kids would go to town with them, and I'd end up with a lot of broken stuff (including toes).  With this set, I can use the door kit and get in a decent work out while keeping an eye on my kids and even talking to them.  If something happens and I need to intervene, I can literally just let go of the handles and run to wherever I need to be to fulfill my parental duties.  If that means taking one of the kids to the potty, I don't have to worry about the other throwing a dumbell at one of the dogs while I'm in the bathroom.  These bands will just hang out for me.  The only really risky thing I've noticed is that one time my daughter started to open the closet door when I was facing away and doing ""benchpresses.""  I'm guessing that might have ended with the bands slingshotting into my back, but luckily I noticed her before I had to find out the hard what happens when the bands fly free.  The kids have tried to play with them, but mostly just jokingly mimicking me.  They aren't strong enough to pull the bands to any degree that would really risk physical harm, and they quickly give up once my workout is over.  After they're done with their ""workouts,"" I just open the door and put these in the closet.  Overall, I think these are a great value.  The package is complete and reasonably priced.  The quality (for me) has been great.  If there is a downside, it's the obvious weight limitation.  You're not going to be entering any Mr. Universe contests using these.  If you want to get *big* you're going to need a *lot* of bands (and you might end up destroying all your doors).  Personally, I'm not looking to get Lifter Huge, I just want to keep my upper body working.  I would consider these good for physical therapy (lots of full range of motion exercises you can do at lower weights), early stage muscle growth, or larger mass maintenance.  They're also great for travel, since you don't have to depend on some spotty hotel gym maybe have the specific equipment you want.",2
Nice and solid product - training is fun and the product allows you to take your gym on the road. only thing i don't like about it is that you always have to lookup which colour matches which weight - a bit more intuitive colours would've been helpful - but that's really just a minor problem.,2
Excellent and sturdy. My only slight criticism is that the fixing the straps to the door attachment is a bit fiddley because the material is too wide to fit easily into the fasteners at the end of the strapt.,2
Great quality and no problems yet. I purchased these as a gift for someone but she never uses them. Everything was packaged nicely and you can combine different tensions to increase the resistance. Most men might need more resistance though.,2
Can't say I know how to hook it up to a door. Instructions would have been nice. But they strap to the bed frame just as easy I guess. Good product.,2
"I found myself spending too much time in the gym and was looking into a home workout system -- something that's thrifty with floor space.  We looked into various systems and decided on resistance bands.  We choose Black Mountain because of the positive feedbacks, and they did not disappoint. Besides, Reistance Band has a natural synergy with our wrought-iron staircase!  I bought a pair of adjustable dogs' collars (cheap and flexible system!) and is able to loop them through the intricate iron works to the height and lateral space desired.  I noted the resistant poundage on the band itself with a label maker; bought myself a set of ankle straps (the one that came with the set only has one ankle strap and it does not have lining; I need two to do leg-raises), and I am set to go to work.  The quality of the bands is good.  The right weight can be arrived at by combining different bands.  Changing the bands with the handle is easy.  After exercising, put everything back into the bag provided for storage, and no one even know that I have a home 'gym'.  I still go to the gym, and I rave about the product to my friends.",2
The bands arrived filthy and covered in dirt.  The handles have crud on them and are dented.  Definitely not a new item.  So disappointing.,2
"I purchased 2 of these sets to help supplement and adjust my current work out routine.  I've currently own a Marcy weight cage that has a dual pulley  system in the rear with attachments centered high and low.  My weight bench is a standard Marcy bench that does not allow for the attachment of a leg developer.  Prior to purchasing this set, I could do single arm flyes from the high position in various formats.  This is an acceptable way to accomplish this exercise if and only if you maintain even counts, form, and weight to avoid lop sided development.  This is a lot harder than it sounds.  With two of these resistance band sets, I am now able to attach bands to my upper right and left supports for true fly type exercises.  Because I purchased 2 sets, I now have 4 handles.  This turned out to be a blessing as it allowed me to loop one set of handles around the upper supports to keep the rubber from the bands from rubbing against any bolt ends or sharper metal edges, while still leaving two handles to perform the exercises.  Additionally, because I ordered two sets, I now have two ankle straps.  This allows me to attach the bands low under my weight bench, looped over the leg restraint foam rollers, and perform normal resistance leg development without the need to purchase a whole new bench.  I've added several new exercises to my routine as a result of this purchase.  The reason for 4 stars as opposed to 5: I have a concern about potential wear on these bands.  I received them in what I would consider to be nearly pristine condition, but running my hands along the bands, I can feel slight nicks in the rubber.  This could be normal, but given how rubber bands work, this could be a future concern.  For now though, it is merely a thought that I check after each usage.  Another concern here is in their usage and not so much a testament to the product.  It must be understood that because these are essentially giant rubber bands, they attempt to snap back to original form.  Make sure to take proper, sturdy, stances when using these.  After much more time with them, I may upgrade them to a 5 star product.  That depends wholly on how they ""wear"" with daily usage.  I would definitely purchase these again and do highly recommend them for usage in your routine, whether it is light duty or heavy duty.",2
"These bands are used every week at my body sculpting class and they're holding up very well. Nicely made. Easy to use and change the handles or add additional bands. Nice little pouch to story them in, too. Good price as well. No complaints. Just what I was hoping for since I wanted my own bands instead of using those little germ-magnets in the exercise studio. Yuck!  ;)",2
Solid bands so far! I like that each end has a carribeaner. I've just ordered a second set because these have been some of the longest lasting and best bands I've ever had. It's been a while of heavy outdoor use and most are still standing. They're just getting busted but I'd recommend these ones for sure.,2
"I have used these daily for six months.  The handles may chip, but this is a good product at a great price.",2
"Very high quality product. This is my second set of Black Mountain Resistance Bands; and by far my favorite of the two. The bands being adjustable resistance (Adding more than one weight band for more strenuous exercises) are perfect for my workouts. The ankle strap allows the addition of several exercises that couldn't be achieved with free weight dumbbells. The door strap provides a single point of resistance for great pulling and pushing exercises- as well as lower body workouts like squats.  Why I like these over dumbbells  - You can add weight simply by adding another band.  - They take up FAR less room than a full weight range set of dumbbells or even the multiple adjustment devices.  - They're much cheaper to purchase and add on to,  - And if you travel and wish to take these with you; they tuck nicely into the bag provided and fit in any suitcase of luggage bag. I even know someone who uses them while at his desk working.  For the price- you can't beat them. I use them often and have never been disappointed with the quality or quantity of exercises these bands can perform. You will not be disappointed by this product!",2
"great resistance band set, so many things that can be done with these. I am really happy I got them.",2
"I keep these at my office and use them from time to time during long conference calls or WebEx meetings that require me to listen or watch but not actively participate. The combination of bands makes it possible to achieve nearly any reasonable level of resistance for curls, tricep extensions, and deltoid raises.  They're handy in hotel rooms when traveling if the hotel gym is too busy or doesn't feature dumbbells.",2
"You get more than you could possibly use and at a very reasonable price.  Very well built, Great hardware.  Takes the place of much more expensive equipment. Company is more than helpful!  Fabulous.  This is probably my best recommendation ever!",2
I use these on my clients to help them reach their strength training goals. the chart helps to give informative feedback on the strength for each band for resistance.,2
"Very resistant product and very durable too, after work with this set next day you feel for sure if make a real good job or not",2
Good quality and value. The carabiner idea is nifty which allows a lot of variations.,2
I just received my purchase today I could NOT be more pleased. Even more the I expected! From the quality down to the small square paper with all contact info and office hours in case anything is wrong. So happy with my purchase! And the booklet with all the workouts: SO detailed and SO useful. I now see why so many people have purchased this product.,2
Minus a star because the part to stick in a door didn't work to well and ended up smacking me in the back and leaving a big welt that hurt extremely bad for maybe a half hour.,2
Fantastic purchase. Very easy to use and I have been getting great results with more toning! It's portable too. I just took the whole set on a plane in my bag and have taken it on long road trips in the car. This is a fantastic way to get portable strength resistance training.,2
"These things are a must have if you're trying to work out with limited space. I got them for my dorm room workout rotation, and I can't imagine not having them at this point. They store easy, give you a good amount of weight resistance, and come with an extremely easy to use door anchor that fits and works well on everything.",2
these are great.  so many different things that can be done with these.  you can work out your arms and shoulders all the way down to calves.  love the different strength bands.... numerous combinations of resistance to make both my husband and myself happy.  I would suggest going on to the internet and do a quick search of resistance band workouts for more ideas on how to work out different areas of your body.  love that you can take these anywhere and use.... we go tent camping quite often and these are thrown in our bag and taken along for workouts.,2
Perfect to keep I shape with out all the large machinery normally found in gyms.....,2
"This seems to be a very nice set.  I've bought their previous set and these new ones have heavier duty carabiners than the previous plastic.  Good padding on the handles.  Nice carrying pouch, too.  The previous pouch was pretty wimpy.",2
"I like it but I have to say I wish they included a way to ""loop"" the band over something to be able to do pull-down or back exercises. I ended up using the ""ankle"" attachment to do that and works for me. Quality is great and would definitely see this lasting me a long time. I love the carabineer because you can use 2 or more at the same time with the handles once you get stronger.",2
"Having a 4 year old, a newborn on the way, and a military spouse.... it is near impossible for me to even consider a gym membership these days! My friend is a fitness coach and she recommended these to me. They go right on your door and there are so many options for how to use them! If you love to workout but cannot afford a gym membership or have a busy schedule, this is the way to go! Also, I would recommend a home pull up bar as well. Use both together and the results can be significant!",2
This product is good... Nice price... But not GREAT... It does the job... I had a previous set of these resistance bands and I can say that after a while (1 Year Or Less)... If you aren't careful with the bands... Some of them could break a lot before... So be careful... It's a good product if you know how to use them... I've bought a new set two weeks ago.,2
Practical and portable fitness kit. Good variety of resistance bands. Simple to use. Haven't tried to use the piece that can be used with door,2
"Not exactly ripped, but prettttay toned.  It's been a couple of years since I bought this, but they still work great and use them almost weekly when I travel to hotels with my work.",2
I received these in the mail yesterday and used them this morning. So great! I've never had this good of a workout without having to go to the gym. It a fantastic alternative to weights- super easy to change which muscle groups you are working. I love that everything rolls up into a tidy small carrying case that it comes with. I live in a shoebox in NYC and the space saving aspect is a tremendous asset.,2
"These bands are awesome. The leg strap and door anchor work well for me. I'm only using them a couple times a week, but I'm definitely happy.",2
I am on the road a lot.  These bands make working out on the road easy.  Take up no room in the suitcase.  You can pack the bands you need and get some good resistance training.  Especially nice when the hotel exercise room is less than advertised.,2
"I was very happily surprised by the quality and variety of the resistance bands as well as the attachment point devices included with this kit. Everything appears to be made from high quality materials and is packed in a convenient nylon pouch (that will hopefully keep me from losing any of the pieces...). The different levels of resistance offered by the color coded bands and combining two or more if necessary, should satisfy pretty much anyone other than a body builder who is looking to gain strength from ultra high resistance. This kit is obviously for rehabilitation of injured and/or weak joints/muscle groups and should be perfect for anyone who is looking for that kind of system.  I'd recommend it and would buy it again.",2
"Nice set. Seems to be sturdy enough for me. Comes with everything you really need. The price was good, and I think I got a good value.",2
"I was a little skeptical at first wondering how I could get a real good workout with bands but that skepticism has vanished after just one workout with these. I was always in the mindset of you have to have barbells,  dumbbells and machines for a workout but now my whole gym fits into a bag.",2
I've actually owned these for a year.  Work muscles at home with door jam attachment and pack for wintering away from home.  I've worked with a trainer ~ these bands fill in just fine when needed.  I thought they might stretch out of shape but that hasn't happened.  I'm focused on upper body strength to ward off further loss of bone density.  Pro-active for strength seems like the a good plan.  I've been happy with Black Mountain Resistance bands.  I use these bands twice a week.,2
"I bought this band set just over 2 years ago and I guess I've been too busy using them to write a proper review.  I take these bands with me literally everywhere.  They live in my bag and when I get bored or need a quick stress reliever, I pop them out and enjoy a little workout.  The build quality on these bands is really top notch.  The rubber has not weathered at all in the two years I have owned them and I cannot see any cracking of any kind.  The handles have good foam padding that shows little to no signs of wear from daily use.  Warranty - Well I finally was able to break one of the bands, the one I use most often.  I emailed the company and Rich, the customer service representative, had a new band out to me in less than 24 hours.  No questions asked, no issue, no worries.  This as to be the best warranty experience I've had with any company.  I will continue to give my business to Black Mountain and recommend them to my friends.",2
This product is exactly as I expected it to be!  They are great and provide such a great work out.  Easy to carry around. I bring them back and forth from work to home.  Even my bosses use them!,2
These have a nice range of resistance and seem like they will last quite a while. Handy for exercising while distracted by something on tv.,2
for the price you get a lot. more than you need actually. i don't use more than two weight bands. and thats where it stays for me. got it because of bad elbow joints using heavy weights and push ups and pull ups. this was a good solution for that. i recommend anyone who struggles with joint issues in their workout to get this. problem solved.,2
"These bands are great.  The only room for improvement would be better carabiners/clips.  The carabiner like things have sticky springs and have sharp edges which could potentially cut through the bands.  It is nice to be able to attach the bands to other things and I have used a bit of rope to tie them off to poles and trees.  Use a bowline around the tree and a linemans loop to secure an additional carabiner to.  This set comes with an exercise guide.  These bands are good when paired with the BMP exercise ball because you can focus on muscle groups.  Isolate the hips for those ab exercises!  Have fun, mix it up!",2
These bands are well made and come in a convenient carrying case.  My whole family shares them.  They are versatile and great for all with the elasticity variations.,2
These bands are great quality and a good price.  I use two and three of them together depending on the exercise and they work well in conjunction.  Handles are comfortable and the set is compact enough that it doesn't take up a lot of room.,2
Great set of bands for daily usage at a reasonable price. Various levels of strength bands included to target different muscles. Received with in a reasonable amount of time.,2
"I have several different bands and these are the least likable, they do not stretch enough and make it way to difficult to use",2
"This set of resistance bands is complete with everything you need for a light workout.  I bought them to help with my shoulder workout.  This is a really nice system.  You get handles, carabiners, ankle strap, and door anchor, along with 5 different resistant bands.  I purchased the wall-mount, 5 position exercise station to use with these, so I am ready for rehab after my upcoming shoulder surgery.",2
I got this for some basic workouts. Does the job well. Definitely can't replace dumbbells though. Took off on star because I really wish it came with a way to wrap up the bands because all the bands being lose will make it a jumbled mess.,2
"I bought this mainly for use when I travel but I also works great when you can't get to the gym.  Amazingly compact as I can easily fit it on my carry-on bag and go anywhere.  It's pretty cool that you can keep all the bands in the door loop and can quickly connect/disconnect the ones you need to do the exercise.  I also like the varied work-out from using weights.  One thing nice is that the resistance increases the further you pull the band, which helps when you are working through an injury as a lot of stress occurs at the beginning of the movement (bad with weights).  Even if you are pretty strong you can get a good workout using a combination of the bands but I will probably get one of the higher weight bands.",2
"My husband drives and only really walks as exercise. His cab is cramped and doesn't have room for weight or other things. So on a whim I bought this one day for him. Although he hasn't been ""motivated"" lately to exercise he did give these a try and likes them. He now uses them quite often as they are so convenient and he can do it regardless of the weather.",2
"Bought these to supplement the other Black Mountain set with attached handles. I blew out the strongest weight on that set, so I picked up this one with interchangeable handles to mix and match bands and increase the weight as I progressed. It can be annoying swapping out the bands between exercises, but it's worth it to avoid the expense and storage of a weight set. Black Mountain has great products, but I would recommend the set with attached handles.",2
This was a great product. I am glad I made this purchase. Product was nicely made and works very well.,2
"Before I bought these I read all the reviews, they are ok  although the handle broke after 3 times of use, definitely expected much more uses.",2
"This resistance band set is great. In fact, I like it so much that I'm ordering another set! I love the ability to add weight by attaching another band, instead of having to deal with two handles in my hand (like the bands that have permanently attached handles). The door anchor, and ankle strap work perfectly, and the carrying bag is a nice touch, as well.",2
"If you like to lift, enjoy having some definition, but hate the gym and lack the space for larger weight sets... Buy this!",2
"UPDATED 12/18/2015. This review has been updated after over a year of regular use of the set 3 times a week. Please, read at least the first paragraph if you plan to use the DOOR ANCHOR included in the set.  This is important usability info. The door anchor included in the set can ruin the bands after a very few uses due to friction of the vulnerable rubber tubes against the rough material of the anchor. This peace clearly requires some technological improvement. I suspected this outcome immediately when inspected the set right after arrival, but, because of the lack of any experience with this kind of equipment, it was assumed that the bands were designed and manufactured to withstand this friction, especially because the enclosed brochure showed some exercises with a band passed through the anchor and handles attached to both ends. After 10-15 rehab sessions both bands showed clear signs of wear and tear in the places of contact with the anchor and a few cracks were found. At that point, after some experimentation, one solution was found, which helped to prolong the lifetime of already damaged bands for over a year,  the anchor was combined with the ankle strap and the bands were passed through the metal ring, which can accommodate up to three bands. The main disadvantage of this solution is that the ring is not large enough to routinely replace the bands, but it was sufficient in my case. A much better solution is to buy an anchor with a protective sleeve or another device that protects the rubber tubes. There are a few different options available on Amazon.com, which will be reviewed below.  Besides the obvious drawback described in the first paragraph the set is quite decent and durable. One practical limitation is that bands included in the set provide only very moderate resistance for major muscle groups even if the strongest three tubes are combined. So, for a reasonably fit man, this set is suitable for rehab rather than strength and muscle building. A premium orange band is available that can help to overcome this limitation, but even this will not be sufficient for a strong man. As was mentioned in the original review below, these bands are not suitable for serious strength building/maintenance.  Actually, it makes sense to limit the resistance of these bands because of technological limitations of the elastic material or tube construction, which, apparently, don't allow regular and prolonged tension beyond the limits of the recommended use of bands included in the set. In my personal example, and I am very far from a body builder, after about 10 months of regular appropriate use following recommendations outlined below in the original review, deep holes developed in two of most frequently used bands. They were monitored, and the bands were still used as before. These holes are not related to the damage described in the first paragraph since they are located quite far from the place of contact with the anchor. So, they are obviously due to some technological fault of the tube construction. By now, one band has had to be decommissioned because the hole started to grow with each use and the band could break any time. According to these observations, the bands are nevertheless quite resilient and don't break suddenly even in the presence of a rather serious damage as in two cases described above.  Recommendations: 1. Consider buying a separate door anchor that prevents the tubes from rubbing against the nylon webbing. I've purchased three different anchors -- SKLZ Pro Door Anchor, Heavy Duty Door Anchor by Albingo, and Lifeline Heavy Duty Door Anchor. Also, I got one with the Bodylastics set mentioned below. All of them have different sizes and constructions and maybe more or less useful in particular situations. Nevertheless, all of them have a common distinctive feature  cable protection from friction. 2. Depending on anticipated strain and load consider buying a more appropriate set of bands/cables. I've purchased Bodylastics Max XT Warrior Edition System, which provides for much greater loads. Also, it's more convenient to use, it looks much more advanced both technologically and aesthetically, and it includes several additional useful items.  Original Review  These bands are as good as most similar products, and they should last for long time with moderate reasonable use. What is different about this set is a shocking number of reports about torn and broken bands that often caused serious injuries and even a few cases of disability. Also, it's quite unusual to read these reports in some 4- and 5-star reviews.  Usually, I don't pay much attention to 1- and 2-star reviews because it's very common for people to have various reasons for dissatisfaction, which have little to do with the quality and usability of the product itself. Actually, since I was going to use the bands for rehabilitation and the number of positive reviews was overwhelming, I decided that this product should serve its purpose for me and bought it in September 2013. This conclusion appeared to be accurate, and, before writing a regular review, I decided to read again what other people were saying. And this time many reviews sounded very alarming, often, apparently, without the author's intention. What could one think reading a 5-star review that asserts that if the exercise equipment breaks, it is beneficial for the user because this indicates increased power of the user, and the sooner it happens the better? And this opinion was not an exception. Somehow, I didn't feel comfortable using this product and conducted in-depth Internet research on similar products including Amazon reviews. The results are as follows:  1. As some reviewers suggested, this product had improved over time, and many reported incidents might not be relevant for new purchases, so it might be prudent to disregard old reviews. Unfortunately, many new positive reviews from 2013 mentioned various quality related issues. This could be due to incorrect use of the bands. 2. Similar products sold on Amazon have much better feedback, and complains are about incomplete sets, delivery issues, wrong band size, etc., but not about damaged bands and injuries. And a few products, such as Bodylastics and JS Fitness sets have almost no negative reviews. I have no intention to advertise anything, but one should not look any farther than Amazon to find some alternatives to compare and make a choice. 3. The bands certainly should not break in a few months and even years unless they are defective or damaged by inappropriate use. Of course, some drivers can wreck a perfectly good car in a few months, but it doesn't indicate they've become superior drivers. If the active or working length of a band is not stretched more than 4 times, the band should serve for many months of daily use. 4. There are bands with built-in protective devices, such as inclosing sleeves and enclosed cords, which should prevent possible injuries and traumas in case of band failure. 5. The flat bands might be a better alternative since their length and, therefore, resistance can be adjusted much easier. They can be folded multiple times if needed, which increases both resistance and reliability. There are extremely heavy duty flat or loop bands suitable for heavy lifting and body building.  Practical recommendations: 1. Inspect every band thoroughly on arrival for any possible defects. 2. Test every band carefully with gradually increased load and inspect thereafter. 3. Contact the manufacturer in case of any issue and/or question. They have excellent customer service, which I had a chance to verify personally on a few occasions. 4. This set should be perfectly fine for light to moderate loads and/or infrequent use. 5. Read the enclosed instructions before using the bands. The most important safety instructions are periodic inspections and overstretch prevention. 6. If no defects are found after a few uses, the bands are likely to be in a good condition and unlikely to break without any indication of wear and tear, which can be revealed by periodic inspections. 7. Avoid stretching the bands more than 4 times their active or working length. Rolling a band around the hand or reducing its length in any other way will reduce its working length. This should not be used to increase resistance (overstretch), but only if there is insufficient room for exercises. Using entire band should always be preferred. 8. Using bands attached to a door, wall, post, etc. effectively doubles the resistance, saves room, and allows for greater control and variety of exercises. 9. Avoid incidental cuts, pinches, scratches, etc., which can damage the band. Always inspect bands after using them in some unusual way and/or by another person. 10. If the items above sound like too much hassle, consider buying more reliable and, possibly, more expensive bands with protective sleeves or cords, which will give you peace of mind and can actually be more economic. 11. Read customer reviews on Amazon very carefully before buying any product if you plan to use it for vigorous and tough exercises.  P.S. A huge number of trivial positive reviews might be caused by the ""free orange band reward"" promised by the manufacturer for a fair review, which can encourage many people to write a few words instead of agreeing with already existing reviews, which would have been much more convenient for new customers.",2
I'm mostly using the black and red bands. The lighter strength ones are pretty much useless to me. Maybe at some point I'll add them to the black and red. The door anchor is ingenious though.,2
These are great to workout with. I love the whole putting the bag in the door way for resistance thing. Because I could never use a pull up bar.,2
I am very pleased with the set.  The multiple bands allow for many configurations of resistance.  I ordered an extra set of handles.  I use the heavier bands and my wife uses the lower bands.,2
"The kit idea is great and the band seem to be very good, but the second time I used them, one of the handle broken in my hand. The handles are nylon, foam and plastic. The foam covered plastic tube broken using just the red band. If there were some way to switch the plastic tubes to alum. or a heavier plastic, I would give them 5 stars.",2
the only thing with this is I would like to have some of the banda a bit shorter. otherwise I enjoy them all.,2
"These bands are really great, I do not mind changing bands on the handle and they are what I needed. My trainer has me working out with different resistance in the gym so these where great for my home gym to help build strength!",2
"I am doing the P90X 3 program, which requires you to go from one exercise to the next without rest. Changing the resistance bands quickly and moving them from place to place is a bit of a hassle. For example, I will use them for a pull up alternative with the door mount, but then I will use them for curls for other shoulder exercises which require a lighter load. So I have to pull the bands all the out of the door mount, remove a couple of bands, do the exercise, put the bands back on and re-thread it through the door mount. Because of the alternating nature of the program, this gets annoying really fast.  The quality is outstanding and the bang for the buck is awesome. My problems with it are not related to the quality of the product, but since it is being sold as an all-in-one solution, some people might want to consider how they will be using these and adjust accordingly.  I might just buy another set.",2
Excellent substitute for free weights. Built better than the cheap ones you get with T25. Would recommend instead of free weights as well if you are on a budget.,2
"I will start my review off on the product. I love my bands. I travel quite a bit and take these bad boys along with me wherever I go. When the weather is bad, I default to my bands and get the exercise that I need. My only concern is the length of the bands. They are very short for certain exercises and you do not get the full extension needed for a workout. Quality is ok and they fit easily into a carry-on.  Now for my thoughts on the Black Mountain Products company. Its concerning that they sell this set on Amazon directly from Black Mountain but they are $3.00 more than their own website. Plus they provide free shipping. Since they are the same product from the same company, why not charge the same price? Go figure. I am sure the extra $3.00 they make per order is being donated to a very important charity....",2
"I bought these to use when I tried P90X, and they wore out around day 60 (I ended up buying the bowflex 5-52 adjustable weights to finish).  I enjoyed them while they lasted, and it should be noted you must have shoes on when using this, otherwise it will pinch/rubber burn your foot...common sense should have told me that I suppose but I learned the hard way haha.",2
"I've only had these for a little while and I did end up buying extra handles (different company though because the handles I got received better reviews and they definitely are better)...I ordered enough handles for all the bands but the strongest since I'm not at that point yet.  I had my husband hang a hook on the back of my door to store the bands and install two different heavy duty hooks on the wall (one at waist level and one at over the door level).  I use these bands on these hooks to work different muscles.  I also ordered the FitDeck (I think that's what their called) for resistance bands and it gives me ideas on how to use these bands best.  I looked on youtube too for some ideas.  These bands are actually fun to use.  I have to figure out a certain routine for myself still but I do like them and they seem pretty sturdy.  I store them up on the back of the door so the cats (I have two) don't get at them.  They love things that hang and they attack (ugh).  I would recommend these as long as they don't break easy...if they do, I'll update.",2
"You can combine these bands to get a wide range of tensions and between the wrist strap, handles and door piece they can be used in a variety of ways.",2
I do the P90X workouts and bought these to use for the training. They work well and provide enough options for different resistance training.,2
"Upon opening, it looks like a Boston Strangler's equipment kit. Seriously...they are perfect for all around resistance rehab or training. Workable for retired folks, too.",2
"I'm using these for P90X.  I love the ability to stack them.  I plan to buy some powerblock dumbbells at some point, but these bands allowed me to get started before making such a lofty investment.  I'll definitely also get the orange and purple bands.  Even after I get some dumbbells, I still think these bands will be a good change-it-up option, and allow me to do some exercises that dumbbells won't really be usable.",2
This a great work out set.  Comes with guide and the door anchor makes it easy to use.  I am in a wheelchair and the door anchor make it easy for me to set up the resistance point for the exercise.,2
These bands were as claimed all sizex and good for me a 5'7 inch 145 pder who loves to use them daily  They pkg was complete leg band good soft handles and door anchor  Great buy,2
I like the bands.  The quality of the bands and the handles are good.  Never used the door anchor or ankle strap.  I do wish there was a way to keep the bands together when you hook several up at the same time.  Overall I am happy and to date have not broken the ends off of any of the bands.  The size is nice and small for taking on the road if you need to.,2
Like the fact that it has multiple tensions and attachments.  I use it for shoulder exercises.  I use it 1 -2 times per week.  No complaints.,2
"Been using them for 2 weeks and very satisfied.  Like others say, the door belt thingy works wonders.  My only issue is that I wish they would sell a set with the purple and orange bands and remove the yellow and blue (for those who want/need heavier resistance).  I was able to by the other two, but they cost $20 more.  Still the quality of the set as a whole is excellent.",2
"Love these resistance bands as they have hooks to change handles and increase weights, easy to use over the traditional ones with out the hook fasteners.  Recommend.",2
This is a high quality set at a very reasonable price.  I use this as a modifier for P90X.  Black Mountain Products customer service is exceptional as well!  You won't be disappointed with this purchase! Good Luck!,2
"These work well. It is easy to attach multiple bands for more resistance. They're easier to use that way if you loosely secure them together in the middle. The weight of each band isn't marked on the band itself, that I could find, which could be a nice addition. Overall, though, they are durable and do what they're made to do.",2
Since you can clip numerous bands to the set of handles it makes it very easy to get to higher resistance levels.  I bring these to the gym and use them in lieu of the gym's as those tend to be use so much that they are stretched out and I cannot get the level of resistance I want.  Great product so far.  I do wish that they had the lbs equivalents stamped on the bands.  I added them in marker to make it easier for me to remember what the sizes are.,2
"The Bands are GREAT, the grips not so much. They are made quite cheaply. Mine broke shortly after my purchase. I ended up making my own. Bands still hold strong.",2
"I always wanted to try a set of bands, and finally got the chance when I found this set. These are great, and even for someone a little technically challenged, they're easy to set up. There's a strap with a larger end, and you put the larger end in between a door to anchor you. Then you just put whichever strength band you'd like through the strap, and you're set to start training! A nifty little exercise booklet comes with the set, and it's an excellent workout. I can't wait to integrate it into my regular workout, as you can use these to train so many different body areas that you can kiss using machines at a the gym goodbye. Not to mention that since the bands allow you to weight train while moving more naturally (unlike machines, which have you doing the same motion again and again), these are also safer to use than the machines. I also get to avoid the unpleasant testosterone-poisoned jerks at my gym and weight train at home, which is always a plus. :)  A+, this will be fun!",2
"I looked around and compared item and price and the best deal was here.  This is a small family company and their products hold there own against the more expensive ones.  Unless you are a workout crazyman or don't take care of them, these bands will last years.",2
"I took these to Physical Therapy today, and my therapist was impressed with the quality and durability of them. She also said the foam grip handles that came with the set were of exceptional quality and a great asset to my workouts. I highly recommend these to anyone going to PT for rehab, or looking to increase strength in a controlled, fluid way (which is best). You'll not find anything better than Black Mountain products, even through the so called medical supply companies.",2
It has hold well for the past 5-6 months that I have been using it continuously. It is perfect portable workout equipment,2
".and said they're a great value. Son loves working out, this gives him a lot of choices. Good set of workout bands.",2
My son asked me to buy this for him--he used it as a sort of home gym while he lived with us. He brought it with him to Cambodia so he must like it.,2
Just exactly what it states. This product was ready to use and comes with some great exercises to start. Very versitile. I would buy there products again and again.,2
These are the same quality the have at my gym.  They are better than I thought they would be for the price.  Great product.,2
"I couldn't be happier.  These were a great price, made in USA, and are high quality.  I'd definitely buy these again and recommend them to a friend.",2
I am very happy with this product. It is well made and gives me a good workout when I am traveling.,2
I have arthritis in my hands and these high-quality resistance bands allow me to do a lot of exercises I can't do with free weights.  Highly recommended.,2
"This is a very durable and well made product; no worries of getting snapped in the face or having the bands break. I've always had trouble with resistant bands because of being a smaller person. These are better adapted to my measurements than any product I've tried. Don't know if I'll ever become strong enough to use all of them, but guys would have no problem. It's a very good product.",2
I got these for P90X and they appear to be very high quality. The bands easily snap together to combine resistance to increase difficulty. The handles also have foam over them for comfort.  I would recommend these to friends.,2
My husband is a pilot and takes one or two of these at a time.  States he gets a great workout from them.  Really not small enough of a bag to take it all at once.,2
"It's been a few days since I've had these so I cannot speak for their durability. You can do just about anything with these bands. I use these bands to pre and post exhaust my body parts during a workout, but you can certainly use them as tools for the main bulk of your workout. I find the bands extremely helpful for arms (shoulders, biceps, triceps), abs (resistance decline situps), and chest (pushups), but you can probably find ways to incorporate every body part. I would recommend YouTube/Google to find creative ways in using these things. If you go beyond the listed exercises, you'll have a much better workout. The only limitations of these bands is your imagination. And that's one of the greatest aspects of these bands: versatility.",2
Everyone in the house uses these bad boys.  Convenient for a quick work out without leaving the house.. I would definitely suggest having these around :) Good strong bands :)  Have fun :],2
I have tried other bands and these are built solid and are holding up. Last pair from different vendor eventually just broke. The connection points are solid and I really like the product. I work out 4 times a week and would highly recommend this product.,2
"Packaged very well and arrived on time. Don't compare it to P90X bands as they are almost double the cost of these. I would definitely purchase other products from BMP. I would also prefer additional handles so do not have to switch out bands constantly while exercising.  Bonus: After providing feedback, you can call them to send you an orange band for free.",2
"I am about half way through the P90X workout and have been using these straps.  So far they have held up well.  Clipping straps onto and off of the handles is quick and easy, so I can move from less to more (or more to less) resistance without hassle.  There is a short guide which tells you the relative resistance of each color band, so you can add up or subtract down to the resistance you want.  While I am sure there are better bands out there, I am also sure you would pay more for them.  This is a good product at a reasonable price.",2
"I have used these regularly for about 2 years. I used them through a round of P90X. I continue to utilize them as part of my workout regimen. I attached an I-bolt to a beam in the basement to attach the cloth strap that came with it. All of the bands, handles, loops, etc are still intact and working. I would definitely recommend this product.",2
"Simple to use anywhere, workout. Bands, connectors and handles are reasonable quality for the price. Door anchor works upper body where I need it the most.",2
"So far, the door anchor and the lightest resistance bands have both snapped. When the door anchor snapped, I went flying across the room and landed hard. I was not seriously injured. The lightest resistance band snapped today and the carabiner part of it was rocketed into the ceiling with enough force to break anything remotely fragile. The scariest of all is that there is no indication that a part is going to break... it happens suddenly. I am nervous to continue using the unbroken products and will buy some free weights when I can afford them.  Edit-  Bought some adjustable dumbells and am much happier using the dumbells for almost all the exercises I would otherwise use with the bands. I still use the bands for a lat pull-down.",2
Been using these bands from time to time and so far so good. Elasticity is great and the accessories come in handy. Just wish they were a tad longer.,2
This set of exercise bands etc. is a great buy. I use them often and they are handy and versatile enough to make adjustments.,2
"This is a pretty decent set of resistance bands. The only thing I would change about it, is that the band themselves are a little bit long. When you put the attachments on them, they are too long to do some of the exercises I would like to do. I have tried to tie the bands in knots to remedy this, but they are very hard to untie, so I try to avoid doing that. Also, if you call the company after you get your package, they will send you a free orange band, which is even stronger than the strongest band in this pack. That was a nice little bonus!",2
Best resistance  bands on the market. Rest for when you're traveling doing P90x or whatever it is you need bands for.,2
"I've had these just about a week. The quality is excellent and exceeded expectations.  It's very easy to change out the handles from band to band, and equally easy to combine bands to give different resitances.  I've tried out the ankle strap and door support and both are good quality, and easy to use.  The quality level for the price is great.  These cost me about the same as one co-pay at the physical therapy center!!  It's also very nice to have this much excercise equipment fit into a tiny case.  I can't predict how long the bands themselves will last under daily use ... i hope to return to this review in 6 months to let you know how things are going.",2
"I purchased ther these for my son after a LOT of research for a Christmas gift, so I can't speak to their long term durability YET, but I'll post an update here after he's used them a bit. My 13 year old son begged for heavy weights and resistance bands after he got to use them at a football training camp.  His doctor advised against heavy weights at his age  (can damage the bone growth and keep your smaller kid small if the growth plate hasn't fused shut yet. Anyhow, the doctor said that resistance bands can still help him bulk up like he wants WITHOUT inhibiting his growth. Yippie!!! SOOO, I started searching for made in the USA resistance bands. Trouble is, there's a catch. Resistance bands are made from rubber from a rubber tree which isn't indigenous to the US. I called and spoke to the owner (two brothers own and run this company, no pesky automated phone line or overseas language barriers to deal with when I called!). These are indeed assembled by hand by the owners in the US but because the rubber comes from Malaysia, they can't call it ""Made in USA"". Grin, but I can. These arrived in two days thanks to the wonders of Amazon Prime and I was VERY impressed with the density and GREAT quality of the bands and ankle strap. You can't beat the price either (I found everything else to be more expensive through Amazon and other sports stores). Plus, I like that my money goes to support a small family owned business rather than support another country's economy. All in all, this was money well spent and should make my son as happy with the purchase as I am.",2
"I bought this for my husband who has a free weight set upstairs which he loves, but he said he likes the bands better and the freedom to use them anywhere he wants.  Total score!",2
My son and husband both use these bands and they are holding up very well. Would recommend them for all ages.,2
"This is a nice assortment of workout bands--the first I've purchased or used.  They connect to the handles quite easily and I love the bag that stores everything nicely.  The single most important item in the kit is the paper that tells you what strength the bands are!  It would have been nice if they included a laminated card with this information, but it's really no big deal.  I am at a lower strength band am anticipating working my way up to the stronger ones eventually.  NOTE:  I have not used the ankle strap or the door anchor, just the handles.",2
They work really well you can use them in any way they even work out with pull-up bars and can attach it bench and use for reverse push-ups,2
"Everything a beginner to resistance bands needs, has different strengths of bands handles, door uses. I just strapped the ankle strap around the support pole in my basement and it worked fine. Love them",2
This is a perfect set to keep packed up for when you are traveling.  They don't take up too much room and if you know what to do with them you can get a complete work out no matter where you are.,2
You can vary your workout and custom it to the part of the body you want to work. It is high quality equipment that can be used for a toning workout or a tough muscle building set.,2
Great price and fast delivery. Quite sturdy and the adjustable band makes it simple to add resistance when needed. Highly recommend this wonderful product.,2
"These are very high quality resistance bands.  The rubber pieces are guaranteed forever.  I just wish there were more than one set of handles, although I'm pretty sure more can be ordered - probably on Amazon.",2
"These were purchased for a relative to assist with their recovery from a debilitating stroke.  The relatively light resistance and ease of use, so far has been 'just what the doctor ordered'.",2
"Work as advertised Great for stretching and toning If you need more weight, try a gym For quick convenient workouts, it does the job",2
"This is one of the best resistance band systems I have seen.  Love the clips changes are very easily, you can adjust for different exercises.  The door hook works great, and the selection of bands let you get a great workout.",2
"For the price and what you get i love it, bands like this shouldn't cost you an arm or a leg and should last and not rip when you put strain on them. these live up to my expectations with repeated use. good buy",2
I love these resistance bands! They came very quickly and as described. They are much stronger than the other bands that I have and were affordable.,2
"I bought this set of bands to work on rehabbing my knee outside of the gym. This type of product is certainly convenient to use and offers a fair amount of resistance for my purposes. However, for those intent on building gobs of muscle, weights are of course ideal. I found that I needed some time to adjust to the feel of these bands. While the manual indicates some type of pound rating it doesn't feel accurate. The nominal rating of weak to strong is a better way to judge the resistance of each band. I chose a familiar exercise that would allow me to work through a range of bands. I knew what I  could lift with weights and compared that sensation to the band with a similar resistance. From there I could start to estimate which bands i might start with  for other exercises. The kit is nicely put together with a wide range of bands and extra straps for doors and ankles. The carrying bag holds everything without being cramped and is well suited for travelling. As another reviewer noted, the bands are rubber and are subject to wear. It behooves the user to inspect them regularly before use.  Update: I have used this kit several times now and wanted to add a finding. I found the exercises more satisfying when contracting and holding the muscles being worked on at the end of the positive movement. This gives extra focus to the area at hand and makes the most out of the resistance that the bands offer. Hopefully, I am not overstating the obvious, but I found this feature easier to do with the bands than with free weights.",2
"So far I am happy with the quality of the bands.  Some people complained that having only 2 handles was a problem, but I figure that I will not be changing weight all that often anyway.  I use them for pullups and dips for my young boys. They can't really do many if any pullups without some assistance.  I like the clips because then you can clip them to the pullup bar instead of using the handles at all and then they don't get in the way of where I put my hands.",2
Just workin on my fitness!  These bands and the various anchors work great.  I like being able to double and triple the bands depending on how much resistance I want.,2
This is a really great set with good quality materials and the bag is a nice method of storage. It's definitely a great value.,2
"full workout in a bag! This set is well made and very versatile. I could carry this on a trip to get a great workout. This is my first tension band set , but I am very satisfied.",2
"Good for those small exercises that one can't do with freeweights. I use it for slight rehab on a knee. It's perfect for that. With the door stoppers you can get angles that really help (if you have old joints). Of course it's all very light, so I can't see doing anything heavy (for those looking for something to supplement freeweights, such as wrapping around barbells when doing squats and so forth) with these, but they're good so far and seem to be made to last.",2
Bought this prior to P90X routine.  Has been great.  Easy to use and durable.  Did find that I wanted more resistance than what was offered to also bought purple band.  Instead of mounting behind hinge of door also put eyebolt into ceiling stud and use this instead which I like a lot better.  Seems like a great product and have been using for 2+ months at this point.,2
"My new triathlon coach started integrating ""tubing"" into my workouts to help build strength for swimming. I purchase these instead of the company's $30 price for only 1 resistance band (aka tube). This has several high quality bands and there is a strap to use in doors and another one that will likely be useful if I want to use it at the gym.  I was really impressed with the quality and the bag.",2
Love them! exactly what I need and if you call you get a free orange band for the collection as well!,2
"I bought this set to have for travel and it works perfectly.  Compact, nicely made and easy to use with the color codes.  Very pleased with the value of this product.",2
I've used these bands a few times without issue or complaint.  I can't comment on longevity though as I haven't had them very long.,2
These are very useful and are just as pictured in their add. I have used them and they are really user friendly.,2
"We purchased two sets of these bands for use with P90X.  We have completed one full cycle of P90X and part of a second cycle, although we eventually switched to weights for most of the program.  We continued to use these bands for pull-ups  The Good: These bands are easy to use, and being able to clip multiple bands onto the handles is helpful.  Some people may need more weight than this set can provide.  Since my wife did not use the ""heaviest"" red band very often, I borrowed hers to make my simulate pull-ups more challenging.  The door strap works well near a hinge, and these bands also worked well over a pull up bar.  Overall they have held up fairly well.  The Bad: Out of our two sets, one strap broke at the metal clasp.  I expected one of the rubber tubes to give out, but instead the metal snapped where the clip swivels around on the post that attaches to the band.  Fortunately no one was hurt when it went, but it left a mark on the top of the door frame when it went during a pull-up.  Some of the bands show a lot of wear from friction when standing on the band to shorten it or to increase tension, as the P90X videos demonstrate.  Again, none of them have snapped, but we stopped using one of the black bands just in case.  Overall:  I liked the bands to get started on P90X, but ultimately decided they weren't giving me the workout I wanted.  As soon as I switched to some ""dial weights"" I felt I was getting a better workout.  The weight ratings on these bands did not match up with using actual weights at all.  In theory, if I was lifting 20 lbs according to the band tension rating, I needed to back down to 10-15 pounds on the free weights.  Still, we were not disappointed in our purchase of these bands.  They are a good value and we are pleased to own and continue to use them.",2
"These are by far amazing!! I have utilized other bands before but these have redefined the way I feel and look at resistance bands! The many different variations for added resistance as opposed to having to utilize a certain band is absolutely genius! The Caribbeaner clip and single pair design is fast and flawlessly designed! Switch resistance in and out in a flash and you are good to go! The space saving, weight avoided and durability is PERFECT if you're looking to get your money's worth while getting the most out of a home workout... such as P90X!!! Highly recommended! :)",2
"This set is great.  Does what it's suppose to and easy to interchange.  I got these for P90X and find myself liking a lighter set-up and heavier set-up.  You'd need 2 sets of handles for that, but this set is great otherwise.",2
"I have had these for about a week now... and i am afraid to use it at full potential...why?  well from the first minute i took it out of the bag, i could tell it is made of cheap material...it just did not feel sturdy or durable enough to handle any demanding exercise or tension... the rubber bands look like they can snap if you push them... and if that happens it could be very dangerous as it might hit you and cause you injury...  i will continue to use and update this review....but regardless of whether anything happens or not...this is not a product i would buy again as it doesn't feel firm or sturdy enough for the kind of tension workouts it is intended for...",2
You get all the bang for your buck! It's a great kit that's worth the money. I would suggest it to a friend and have purchased this for friends.,2
"Works well, strong, and does not snap back in you face. Works well with two people of different strengths. Great",2
They provide a wide range of resistance to make your workout progressively more difficult to strengthen your body. They include a hoe to booklet that is quite useful.,2
"I love it! I ordered it while I was in Afghanistan. I used it daily for strength training. The only thing I would change is the material of the storage bag. Its cheap and weak, it started tearing about 2 weeks after I received it. Overall, great, and I do mean great product..",2
"I am using these bands for P90X and they work GREAT! There are a lot of complaints for bands (these bands included) about tears in bands. If that happens, contact customer support. I got my band replaced for free and it arrived 3 days later. Customer support is AWESOME. Wear and tear WILL happen even when used properly.  For my next run at P90X, I'm going to add in the orange and purple bands for that extra range of weight! Great product, great support.",2
My wife and I use these and they work great! No problems so far. I would definitely buy another set.,2
"Not a whole lot to say about them, other than the fact they seem like good quality bands that have lasted well over a year now. I don't use them daily, but try to get a couple uses a week. I'm happy with the purchase.",2
"I absolutely love these resistance bands! You have every amount of resistance you could need, and bands can be easily added together to get your perfect resistance. The handles are comfortable, and the door anchor does stay in the door. I was a little scared to try the door anchor because I was afraid it was going to come flying out and hit me in the face, but I tested it using a long broom lol. I do love using resistance bands instead of weights because you get lean muscle instead of bulky muscle like from free weights. This is a great set, and I highly recommend them.",2
I travel with these and it don't add a lot weight like dumbbells do. I go online and get workout ideas since the pamphlet that came with it is not that great. Overall great product.,2
Great power bands Diferent resistance and easy to add resistance to the same grip they seem to be well made work perfectly,2
I bought one set for my wife and my mother in law came over and tried them out so i irdered a set for her. They work great.,2
I bought these bands to use for the p90 x workouts. They are very sturdy and do not crimp when stepping on them as some other products do. I have used them about a month so far and they show no signs of wear. They are the best of all the resistance bands out there.,2
"Bought this for my wife as a tool to use to do mild exercises while she is going through chemotherapy.  She is 56 and has a hard time, no; she cant use the cables for most of the exercises because the cables are too long. She has to double over the cables so the length is not too long.  This would be fine if there was a second door and ankle attachment, but there is not! She does use one cable at a time and does find the construction very good.  The variety of band resistances are nice as well as the exercise instruction book.",2
"My only previous experience with resistance bands was rehab following knee and back injuries.  I saw limited use and limited results for them.  No way they could be used for any serious purpose,  I thought.  Limited to light resistance, hi-rep functional strengthening and conditioning within the confines of a physical therapist's office - boy, was I wrong!  I lift 5 days a week, and love to incorporate cable machines for full range of motion resistance.  Only problem is (was) that I don't have access to a cable machine at home or on the road and getting to the gym at 0530hrs was an exercise in self-discipline.  I looked at several other band sets from many other manufacturers before selecting Black Mountain.  At this price and with a 90-day return policy and lifetime warranty, if I didn't like them I could return them or let the wife and kids use them.  Throw in ""Made in the USA"" and I figured they were worth an audition.  Well, color me impressed!  I can easily replicate all of the exercises I used to perform on cables and more.  Rows, lat pulldowns, crossover chest pulls, hammer curls, concentration curls, tricep extensions and pulldowns - these have even replaced freeweights for lunges, good-mornings, and calf raises!  Even with no freeweights, you can still get a full-body workout with these bands, and add-ons are available to up the resistance.  Believe me, the pump you feel after a workout with these is every bit as good as you'll feel leaving a gym.  I like the stackability of these over the individual bands with handles - you can mix and match throughout your sets to increase resistance between sets.  With the handles, door anchor, and ankle strap, there really isn't anything you can't do on the go out of the small carrying bag.  The quality is great - at first I was a little hesitant to put too much weight on the thick nylon anchor, but now I am more concerned about the door frame I put it in!  The foam handles are comfortably sized, and you can even slide them in the loops to replicate pronated and supinated hand positions for various exercises.  Now these can't be this good without a few minor limitations.  You do need to be creative with positioning the bands or your body to perform some exercises - you'll find them too long for some, too short for others.  I'm 6'3"" and my wife is 5'7"" - we both have to make some accommodations, but there is nothing we just cannot do.  Also, the addition or option of a bar would be awesome - hint, hint BMP!  All in all, great product - we get great strength training workouts in minimal space.  Whether you are looking to augment freeweights and eliminate cables (like me), or looking to use these exclusively for strengthening and conditioning (like my wife), you will not be disappointed!",2
"My husband and I have been working out in our ""home gym"" consistently for 2 months now.  We had two resistance bands that only had hand holds.  This made it very difficult to do anything but upper body exercises.  These offer a ton of options now.  They are also easily convertable from hand strap to leg strap to door anchor.  We love them.",2
What you see in the photo is what you get along with a guide for the resistance of each band or combo of bands.  It took a while to get this item delivered.  Ordered on the 23rd of May and didn't get it until the 3rd of June.  Seemed like a longer that usual time to get it to my home mail box.  Snail mail was indeed snail mail in this instance.  I got these bands to facilitate some rehab exercises for my back post surgery.  I think they are a great value for all that you get and they seem to be very well constructed.  I looked around before I got these bands and there are really a lot of choices out there.  I think this set is one of the best values for the money.  They would also work well for travel as an exercise system in a very small bag that comes with the kit.  I really like the adaptor that allows you to hook into a door jamb v. having to us a door knob.  Also the ankle piece is nice to have as well.,2
"I used to bodybuild and from lifting heavy weight my joints started to hurt. So I bought these resistance bands and they work great. They are not heavy but after so my repitions you can feel the burn. I work out home, work, and on the go. I a gym in the bag.",2
"I bought these bands for some rehab at home after having surgery on a severe tendon tear in my shoulder.  The easier bands are all I have been able to use thus far, however, I'm looking forward to using the heavier blue and black ones once my strength comes back.  I also happen to be a Certified Personal Fitness Trainer and would definitely use this equipment if I was working with a beginner or intermediate (male or female) at their home or office.  VERY VERSATILE equipment that allows for an incredible range of motion/movements.  The clips are easy to attach/detach and the door anchor allows a full range of positioning.  There are probably 50 different exercises (maybe more) you can do with these bands.  One word of caution - even the toughest band wouldn't be enough for an extremely strong person, so if you bench 400 and do 150 lbs on tricep pull-downs, you may have outgrown some of this equipment or will be bored with it.  However, even for the biggest person, there are some neat balance exercises and small muscle groups you could work on.  I really like this set so far.  Quality seems excellent, however if I have any problems with it, I will update my review.",2
This was a great surprise for the money.  I looked at resistance band workouts on YouTube and decided to try it out. At this price why not?  I really feel like I had a good workout after my first try.  The door anchor worked great.  I'm 71 and keeping big equipment around the house is just not possible.  This I just keep in my night stand and any time I've got some extra minutes I do a little workout.  Pleasantly surprised and pleased.  I highly recommend.,2
"I'm using this to work out my hips for an IT Band issue.  I tried using it for a full workout, but just don't like a resistance band workout for my full body.  But for my hips, the door peice is awesome.",2
The band work exactly as expected. The only minor complaint I have is the handgrips on my set had some indents in the foam grip that I find distracting.,2
"Personally, I don't think Resistance Bands get enough good press.  If your wanting to tone, trim, and sculpt your physic, rehab injuries...this band set will do it!  Pay a annual membership to a gym or spend $30 one time.  Your choice!  Worth every penny!",2
"Very pleased with product, build quality just as expected and top notch. Been using daily for weeks, strength and durability seem to be very good, and resistance levels are MORE then adequate for most any exercise. Also QUITE enjoy the versatility of being able to manipulate the different resistance levels by adding/removing the different bands from the primary hand grip ring, very easy and quick to use.... Very helpful in adding that extra element to any fitness routine!",2
"Good variety of strengths for the bands.  Best combination that I found.  Instruction booklet should have more uses for legs - has just one.  I've come up with quite a few, to imitate my Pilates machine, for stretches away from home.",2
i purchased these to help with a shoulder injury and now that that's healed up they're great for everyday training/ traveling. Just throw them in your bag and you don't have to worry about the hotels gym.,2
THE BANDS WORK GREAT.THE ONLY DOWN SIDE IS THEY SHOULD HAVE ADDED ANOTHER ANKLE STRAP SO YOU COULD USE TWO BANDS TOGETHER.,2
"I had to stop going to the gym because of my back.  These resistance bands provide a very low impact work out, along with a good starting program with the included booklet.  My son even uses the lowest resistance band when he works out with me.",2
"I am really big fan of Lifeline products and was about to buy similar product by them. But, I decided to get these as this was 10 times cheaper. I am so glad I did; I am sure lifeline are great. But, these are also awesome! really nice. I will be buying another set for a friend. Sorry Lifeline, but, these killed you and a lot cheaper.",2
"I highly recommend theses bands! I love the door anchor that comes with this set also! I previously used a cheap set of resistance bands (Gold's Gym, I think) and these are so much better. Such a good workout with these!!",2
This is the second set I have purchased and the hooks for the bands are not as nice as the first set so I am only giving it 4 stars so far. Hopefully they last longer than the last set (lasted about 6 months). But at this price it is still cheaper than a gym membership.,2
"My wife and I both use these, and they are great.  If you have a good DVD routine or even check out YouTube you can use these to their full advantage.  You're not going to get super bulky using these, but they do work you out. I've found that I can double up on different bands to get more resistance, and my wife can just use one or two at a time to get less resistance.  We really like them, and I'm sure you will to.",2
"Nice handles too.  The clips on the handles make it easy to combine multiple bands for extra resistance.  At the price, I don't see how you can beat it.",2
"Lots of cables and cords. Can mix and match as needed. I use them for p90x in a small house without weights. They give you lots of options, you can affix them to the door, hang them up high, down low, etc. Very versatile.",2
works well and comes with alot of extra stuff a good workout for limited space and if you travel. 15min and you can feel your heart rate climb and a good sweat if used right,2
"this is perfect for what i need them for. i kept reading other reviews of the eyelets breaking or the straps and handles but these seemed to look to be sturdy needless to say I'm unsure of when mine exactly broke but the inside of the handle has a crack, it hasn't broke completely but I'm uneasy of using them on a daily basis so now they're just used every once in a while.",2
"If you are creative, you can do almost any exercise with these bands, and they all fit into a small tote bag.  Build quality is good -they are durable.",2
"I haven't had any problems with these whatsoever.  The cables, handles, and straps are all great.  You can get just about any workout you want in by combining these bands - anything from power lifting to light aerobic training.  GREAT!",2
I bought this set a little over a month ago and use the bands several times a week.  This is by far the best deal I have found for bands and I am totally amazed with the quality and the good assortment of bands provided with the set.  Love it and really cannot say enough good things about this item.,2
"After purchasing and returning two other resistance band products because they didn't even come close to the caliber of product I use as a Certified Trainer at the Wellness Center where I work, it was with a little trepidation that I ordered the Black Mountain Set. From the speed with which it was delivered, to the carry bag and most importantly the ""industrial"" quality of the product, any fear I held was dismissed. This is simply a great product. I've built it into the programs that I use with clients (particularly my ""road warriors"" who need a small profile exercise equipment set when travelling), You have to see the heavy duty guage of the metal clips and feel the stretch/resiliency of the tubes to appreciate just how good this set is. Don't waste time with the ""name brand"" or celebrity endorsed products - go with the BMP set.",2
"I ordered these to do P90X without having a plethora of dumbbells strewn about my house. These take up no space, they are just as effective as weights, and they are much cheaper. The company is top notch as well... if you need help or have any questions about your product, they are happy to assist. I will certainly be recommending these to everyone I know. Thanks, BMP!",2
"We looked at many resistance bands and band sets in our local stores, but this set is much sturdier and complete than anything we found locally.  My husband has developed a cubical style workout to do in his truck cab while on the road (to rehab. an arm injury).  These bands are perfect for that workout. We are impressed with the product and will gladly buy from this seller again.  Shipping was very fast and the information was accurate.  Thanks!",2
"This is a great set of resistance bands. It comes with a variety of bands equaling different amounts of pound resistance. It also comes with the ankle straps if you want to use the bands to do leg exercises as well 2 handles to clip the band(s) onto for arm exercises. There is a bag if you care to store them in the bag and a small paper booklet giving you some examples of different exercises you can do.  These are a good alternative to free weights or weight machines. You can do so many different exercises with them and work a variety of muscles.  Keep in mind, if one band doesn't satisfy your weight resistance desire, you can double or triple them up, just hook them onto the handle or ankle strap and work with the combined resistance. I have been using these for a little over a month and stretching them pretty good during my use, and I see no signs of wear or tear.  Anyone looking to add a little variety to their workout or for an alternative to weights or machines, I would definitely give these a try.",2
I purchased this to strengthen myself after a car accident and my physical therapy has finished. I have been using these for about 6 weeks and I have found this is better quality than others I have used. The bands have very good resistance.,2
These bands are made of good latex. The carrying case is nice. I like how you can attach multiple bands to the handles to create a custom resistance level. The door anchor works well also.,2
These bands arrived promptly. They were in mint condition. They were a gift and the person who received them was thrilled with them. They loved the selection of levels of difficulty the bands offer as well as the bag since she travels with them. Thank you!,2
"I have used these bands for over a year.  I had issues when one of the clipss broke.  I contacted the company and they sent out a replacement, no questions asked.  Really happy with this company.  I bought a 2nd set for my sister becuase of their customer service!",2
"My husband and I have both been using these cords for about a month. We both love them as they are so easy to use and you can bring them anywhere. He did a workout at a trailhead the other day. We have purchased a couple of videos to learn more exercises. There are very good but basic ones described in the enclosed booklet to get you started. They look well made, but I think you should inspect them periodically to make sure your shoes haven't damaged them during workouts. We camp a lot during the summer and these will definately go along on every trip. You can do stretching, strength training and use them in an aerobic routine and feel them working. Can't go wrong with these!",2
"I really like these bands. Keep in mind, they're for toning the muscles, not for building big muscles. They seem to be of good quality. I saw some reviews where they snapped, but, I haven't had an issue with them. I bought them on the gold box deal for half the price of some of the other bands Amazon sells.",2
"This is the second of these I've bought.  I had one before and gave it to a friend.  I like that the ends and the bands are interchangeable and that you can easily combine multiple bands on the same end to get different resistance levels.  I was originally going to buy a pull-up assist band, but realized that I can use this for that purpose but also get all the other benefits of multiple bands for general exercising!",2
"I was impressed with the quality and design of these bands. They come with two handles, which attach to the bands with carabiners. I especially like the design of the door attachment. Unlike the other band and attachment I have, this one just slips through the crack and is held in place by a clump of metal that's sewn into the nylon strap. When the door is open, you can poke the clump through the gap on the hinge side. When the door is closed, it's way too big to get pulled back through. I also like how you can hook two or more bands to the handles to create more resistance as you get stronger.",2
"I have free weights, but I don't want to lug them all over the house to work out.  And for the most part I don't use them where they are stored.  These really help out if I want to move to a different room or even when I'm on the go.",2
strong and stacking them togther gives me a workout just as good as the gym would so now its time to get in shape,2
"This was one gift that will give back, great tension and feels strong, A good work out for all. I'm going to get me one next time.",2
This product is exactly what it claims to be.  Switching bands is easy and you can add multiple bands at a time for more resistance.,2
"Plenty of different band widths, and since you can combine multiple bands on handles, you have a large variety of resistances.  Comes with two nice handles, a strong velcro wraparound, and a carry bag.",2
"Bands are good quality and work pretty well. Since I haven't used resistance bands before some more fool-proof instructions would be nice, but the product itself is great!",2
These bands are great. I really like the removable handles vs. fixed handle bands. The orange band promotion is great too. I got mine the day after I called.,2
"I currently use these bands for my P90x!  Pros: You can use multiple bands as they clip onto the grip. Included ankle strap Included door strap (for pull ups/etc) **this saved me from having to put a hook into the stud of my wall Comes with a nice carry bag  Cons: They don't tell you that you could also get a FREE ORANGE BAND!!! with FREE SHIPPING! lol... I called them up because there was a little paper inside and he said just leave your feedback, anonymous or not ""we don't check it"" and call us back, we would be glad to send you an orange band free of shipping. We do this for about 10% of our kits.  Why complain? Right?... Keep up the good work!  -Mike Reed Dallas,TX",2
"I purchased these bands so I could exercise on an upcoming trip.  However, I've been using them at home and have found that they are very versatile.  The door anchor is wonderful as I can attach my bands at any height.  I also can easily use multiple bands together.  Wish I had gotten these earlier!",2
I am very happy with these. It was a great deal and I received them in very good time. They work really well. I really liked the carry bag that came with it!,2
nice to have all in a bag and ready to use having the different strength makes it easy to move on in therapy should have noticed that the bands are not covered - but they will last as long as we need them,2
My arms are burning as I try to type this review. I wasn't looking for a muscle building as much as a muscle defining device and this is the best on a budget with not much room to put much else. Between these and a jump rope you have everything you need to tone up and stay in shape! They seem well constructed but only time will tell how they hold up. I'll revisit this review in a couple months to give a accurate update on exactly they held up.,2
The product came just as advertised. Easy to set up and use and the bag is nice if you plan on working out when you travel.,2
"My son wanted a workout set that didn't take up too much space in the dorm.  He goes to the gym but wanted to have options for hours when the gym isn't open.  This set is great and is very compact, yet offers a good variety of resistance settings.",2
"Excellent resistance bands, I use them at work, so that I can get a quick strengthening session during breaks.  Seems to be of good quality. Customer service is awesome, I got a free Orange band just for calling. No questions asked, not extra purchase necessary.  Love it so far.",2
"Exactly what was showed in the ad...  exactly what i needed..  no regrets.. fully recomendad!  good quality, shipped on time.",2
This equipment gives you the utilities that you need to do whatever resistance exercises you want to do.  Includes a bit of paper with cord resistance values and suggested exercises.  I would buy again.,2
"I purchased the Black Mountain Resistance Band Set to allow me to do strength training when I travel.  I had previously purchased another name brand set of resistance bands, but they had plastic D rings that would slip under strain.  The metal D rings and O rings on this set is a much improved upgrade for me.  The door holder and foot strap completes the accessories.  The set is easy to use and the bands are strong enough to meet the workout needs.  This is a high quality set or resistance bands.  The only negatives would be the work-out instructions are weak.  I downloaded a more comprehensive work-out guide for resistance bands that have better diagrams and more exercises.  Also, using multiple bands can be tricky.  It would be nice if there was a sleeve that would gather the bands when using three or more for safety and ease of use.  Overall, the quality for the price is outstanding.  I would recommend these to anyone who would like a good quality set of resistance bands.",2
Instructions of the exercises are a little hard to follow; but seems to be made well and I think it will last a while.,2
"I've used other resistance bands, and after about 3 months they typically snap.  These have been going strong 2-3 times a week for 6 months and no breaks.  Good assortment of weights and combinations, can't go wrong.",2
"EL PRUDUCTO FUE ENTREGADO CON LAS ESPECIFICACIONES MOSTRADAS, EN EL TIEMPO OPORTUNO Y EN LA FECHA ESTIMADA. RECOMIENDO 100%. EXCELENTE PRODUCTO!!",2
"Gave this as a gift to my wife who like bands better than free weights.  Includes everything you need for a resistance band set.  5 bands for 5 different levels of resistance.  Well-made with 2 handles.  Can also combine bands to get different resistance combos.  Carrying bag, clever door anchor, ankle strap included.",2
"Resistance bands are durable and great for the price... unfortunately for a lot of the workouts I want to do they are too short, which is such a shame.",2
"We were very impressed with the quality of these bands .  We bought these to replace a set purchased at a local box store, which weren't nearly as nice as the Black Mountain set .",2
"I bought these bands a few months ago as a way of diversifying my workout - I'd been a dumbbells and chin-up bar guy until then.  I find the bands to be well-made and sturdy, and I like the design of the clips and removable handle.  It means that I'm dealing with less bulk, of which I'm always a fan.  Plus, because the clips swivel, there's never an issue with ""going against the grain"" that I've felt with other bands.  Ultimately, though, these are better for someone needing a lighter workout than I.  Thus, my girlfriend loves them, but I have limited use for them.  This is probably my own fault, though, so I will get a band of higher resistance from BMP and I think it will have greater utility.",2
"Love the wide variety of resistances you can combine. Because I don't have room for a weight set with bench, these bands and an exercise ball are perfect for my workout.",2
"I bought these maybe 3 or 4 months ago and have used them, or 3 of them on a regular basis.  As far as use goes they work great.  It is convienent to have each individual band clip in.  At least until they show signs of wear or break, and they will.  Then you have to throw away the whole band.  There is nothing inherently wrong with these bands.  My purspose in writing a review was to caution users of these and all exercise bands.  I've had two bands break on me.  The first, a competitors, snapped back into my face, cutting and bruising me below my lip.  It then snapped back and took out a piece of my wall.  The second band to break (one of these) snapped in the middle and didn't harm me.  Upon closer examination I saw small holes beginning in the bands.  My suggestion is to routinely inspect your bands (as I do now) and wear eye protection when using them.  Even if you ignore my advice just know that they will not last forever.  They will eventually break.",2
"I originally ordered this to use on a vacation, when it arrived I tried it out. This might replace my free weights and I won't be ordering a total gym(I had been looking at getting one when I come back from vacation) for a while thanks to this package.  Pros: - lots of options- 5 bands, 2 handles, 1 wrapstrap, and one door attachment. It also come with some helpful instructions(some exercise ideas in it) and what looks like a great warranty. I won't be using the heavier bands for a while but my boyfriend likes them. Use it on the floor, standing, or with the door. - quick and easy- You can use one band or multiples, it is quick to change bands and workouts, and you don't have to detach the bands to put them through the door strap. - comfy- The handles are padded and rotate so they don't tweak your hands, the rubber doesn't catch any little body hairs, and the velcro wrapstrap is nicely padded. It is a little stiff, but it should relax with use. - door attachment- Mentioned above, but my favorite attachment. A lot of overhead tricep moves hurt my elbow but with the door I can pull down instead and it feels good and strong. I have other straps and resistance bands but these are way nicer. I use the door thing most in the 2 times I've used the kit, and I can't rave enough about it. Use it for inner or outer thighs while standing, to help with situps or add resistance to them, use it to work on pushups while standing, or rowing moves. Its great. You can change the workout just by turning around. - travels well- The bag it come with is nice and small, everything fits in it, will fit in a suitcase easily, and I can see using in a hotel room no trouble. - great price  Cons: None so far!  EDIT: Some reviews say the bands are too long or short for certain moves. If they are too short don't double it, instead of stepping on middle and raising both ends, step on one end and raise the other end. If they are too long, like for certain leg moves, then double it. The door strap makes length a non-issue for me, I just move closer or further from the door. For leg stuff without the door, I put the wrapstrap on one ankle, connect both ends to the metal loop and put the middle around the other ankle for side steps.  Edit: one of the rotating metal pieces on one of my bands popped off. I looked at it after catching my breath and it looked like a small manufacturing error where the hole was just big enough to slip. I contacted customer service and within a week I had a brand new band. Easiest thing ever, and they really stand by the warranty",2
"easy to pack up this equipment to travel.  it is also easy to store and easy to use at home. it takes up no large footprint in the house but it is easy to access and simple to use. the multiple ""strengths"" of the cords make it easy to get a decent workout.",2
"Buy it, period. Don't even look at another set.  It's rare you find a product that is of incredibly high quality and yet still affordable. Yes, I realize these are basically rubber tubes...but the quality of the stitching, hardware and padding on the accessories (handles, ankle wrap and door hang) are second-to-none and make a huge difference in the comfort of your workout.  We bought the first set, and were incredibly happy with it, so bought a second set to increase our weight capacity and enable us to transition while circuit training quicker. Really, REALLY excellent set, and the basic exercises sheet that comes with it will give you a great overall full-body workout.",2
I feel like this product is great for the occasional workout use but if you are hardcore and plan on using these on a daily/weekly basis then this product may not be for you.  The bands are a bit flimsy and you need to have the right shoe sole for the band to stick under your feet and stay there. Worth buying for the price compared to actual weights.,2
"BACKGROUND Currently, I am in the process of starting my second round with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/P90X-Tony-Horton-s-90-Day-Extreme-Home-Fitness-Workout-DVD-Program/dp/B000TG8D6I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">P90X: Tony Horton's 90-Day Extreme Home Fitness Workout DVD Program</a>. The exercises call for some equipment to be utilized. If you lack that equipment, the program shows those preforming the exercises utilizing alternative methods to complete the routine. I thought it would be nice to mix up the different methods for something different.  REVIEW: The purchased showed up with everything included in the photo. There was the carrying case, an instruction manual that was brief but explained what the combination of colors would add up to, an ankle/soft grip strap, and a door anchor.  The resistant bands are of a higher quality. I tried out the resistant bands in the store and felt that the material making up the bands including the clips were very cheap. These feel durable and have held up quite well through vigorous usage during this second round of P90X.  I know it states one size fits all. Myself, I am 5'8, these bands are perfect. If you are shorter and have slack, you are able to adjust. If you are a taller male, you might have some issues preforming the exercises to their full extend since they will not stretch the distance you need them to.  PRO: ++ Durable material. Built to last ++ Includes everything needed in one set up plus extras to complete exercise routines ++ Great for any exercise routine as well as physical therapy if lifting weights is too great but need natural resistance  CON: ++ Only one set of handles included. Annoying to continuously switch bands during work out routine ++ Need labels on bands so I can remember the weight strength  CONCLUSION: These are a great addition to anyones work out gear collection. They are durable and able to fill a variety of roles from additional exercise routines to aiding with physical therapy. A recommended purchase.",2
Ive used only a few resistance bands on normally the ones that come with different games for XBOX and Wii.  Bought 1 or 2 others from Sporting goods stores.  WHen I got these I was amazed how much better they are.  Very solid construction and durability.  Ive only had for a day but did a full workout using all the bands and I don't see any probs in the near future.  Will  of course update if so but..  Anyways 5 stars and no complaints.,2
"I just received bands yesterday, and I was just testing out the feel of the green and black bands together and after 4 curls...the metal part of the green band popped out of the connecting socket and snapped into my foot.  Thanks to the poor quality of this product, I now have a giant welt on my foot. Just to let everyone know I am 5'11 and 160lb, by no means a BIG guy, and was not even close to pulling with full force. Perhaps I just received a lemon, but I'm demanding a refund. I would advise any potential buyers to be careful.",2
"As most exercise products, these were used a few times, and stored away in the bag for a few months. I took them out to start using them again after a car accident has kept me off the free weights, and the bands are starting to discolor and fade. Makes me nervous that the integrity of the rubber is weakening...",2
"These bands are great, I started using them after dislocating a shoulder again and I really like them.  At 5'6"" I have no height issues with the band length and find them as versatile as my imagination for exercises.  As a gymnastics coach, I have a pretty good imagination when it comes to exercises.  the door anchor and ankle strap are both good quality.  The bands, although not a substitute for gymnastics rings, high bar and the like are really really great for a whole bunch of exercises.  Using one of the band combinations with the door anchor I got a couple of really good ab exercise and some good pullovers (for muscle ups).  Sure today I was able to do some levers so but these exercises are really helping me stay strong through injury and I can see them going way beyond.  Far better and more versatile than weights, these band are fun and create exercises that require small muscle stabilization far better then weight machines.  For the price you could do far worse.  If you're one of those folks in a DVD program, start to improvise, do what feels good.  Yes I have push up bars, I use them for handstand practice, really good stuff.  Get them and enjoy.  If you're a serious pump monkey, keep these around for vacations or while watching tv.  I have since purchased some of the new heavier pull bands, this product is now an exercise stable for a gymnastics coach.  The nature of them makes them better than free weights and the versatility of exercises is amazing.  I have a pull up bar identical to the one Black Mountain sells, you can do some really cool stuff, limited only by strength and imagination.  As an aside, the Black Mountain guys are really nice and answer all questions.  All bands and handles are reasonably priced.",2
Great quality with a lifetime warrantee. The bands have metal d-rings that are sturdy. Not like the plastic ones they had at your target and walmart. You get 5 bands of different resistance and other goodies. I enjoy using them and it gives me a great workout.,2
"I love these resistance band so much I bought a second set. I have worked out most of my adult life (53 yrs old) primarily with weights. The past 10 yrs found weights hurt my joints. Real bummer. I was not sure how good a workout I would get with resistance bands, but have found the resistance bands allow me to get a great workout without the joint pain. The quality of the bands are quite good.  Thanks Black Mountain. Staying fit without the joint pain.",2
"When I bought the previous version that had the swivel clips I wasn't to keen on using it too much. But now that they changed to standard carabineers instead, I decided to buy a second set, which I use more regularly. Also I recommend getting the new extra strength orange and purple bands, sold separately. I would say the only drawback may be is that the bands, all bands not just the two mentioned, are a little short for some people, and probably best suited for people in the 5'4"" to 5'9"" range. I'm not saying people below and above that range shouldn't get a set. Let me just make it clear the height range I gave is not a concrete standard. It's just an opinion as to how I feel. I'm 5'11"" and I'm very careful how I use my bands. Black Mountain is a very good company with awesome customer service, and they're always working on improving their products. For the price and some common sense usage it's tough to find a better basic set than this. My previous swivel end set is a souvenir I keep in my closet. I hope they come out with a new set the has all 7 bands, 2 ankle straps instead of just 1, 2 sets of handles that are bigger than what they have now, a door anchor with a cushioned liner, and a really nice bag to put it in. If and when that comes out I'll be getting that for sure and ready to post a 5 star review.",2
"I have been working out with weights for nearly 30 years.  But there were a number of exercises I could not do well due to shoulder, tennis elbow irritations, and kinks in the knee.  I couldn't do shoulder presses, any type of dumbbell presses or flies, tricep pullovers, preacher curls, bench press, rear deltoid flies, barbell squats, etc. Upon switching to the resistance bands I have been able to do all of these exercises and more with no problems whatsoever.  And I have been doing very heavy resistance with the bands.  After having a bad shoulder for over 20 years, I never dreamed this kind of intense workouts would be possible again. the resistance bands have strengthened my shoulder.  I am stronger now than I have been in a long, long time.   the bands are strong and sturdy.  I have no problems lifting them overhead, clipping on 3 and 4 bands at a time.  I did buy some loop bands from discount-bands.com, which seems to be a part of Amazon.  they are unbreakable.  I do squats, shrugs, and heavy stuff with the loop bands.  the squats are great with the loop bands, with less stress on the back than a barbell.  Not much need for iron weights and the gym any more.  But I have not lost any muscle strength. with some thought, there is no muscle that resistance bands cannot work in a very effective way.",2
"These bands are some of the most well constructed I have seen.  They also have clips on the ends which allows them to be used in tandem, so the red, black, green, blue, and yellow can all be used together for extra resistance, which is a major plus for athletes who need more resistance.  The door anchor included is a very simple design, but it works well.  All of the bands also have a lifetime warranty, just call them and they will ship you a new one (you have to pay shipping though).  The handles are well constructed, and the wrap around handle is pretty standard universal gym type stuff.  Will buy from this company again.",2
"I bought this to help me exercise while recovering from an injury which kept me from my usual routine. I didn't expect much from some elastic bands.  However, I found that I actually really like this product.  I use it every day at work and at home.  I hook up the band under my desk at work and workout my legs while sitting at my desk.  At home I get a very good, full body workout. I like the handles and the ankle band... I only wish it came with two ankle bands.  I don't suppose there is much difference between brands but, after using it every day for about a month now, I have to say this product is exactly what I was looking for.",2
"I bought these resistance bands to use along with P90x, and so far they are holding up well. It's been about 2 weeks since I've started using them and none of the bands have broken yet (as some reviewers have mentioned). I don't yet know how they will hold up in the long run, but I'm not too concerned about them since Black Mountain Products has a great warranty on them.  They come with 1 set of grips that attach to each of the bands via a metal clasp. If there isn't a weight that you like in each of the bands, you can combine multiple bands and customize the weight yourself.  I really like these, and assuming they hold up - I give it 4 stars.",2
"This product is pretty awesome - I use it almost everyday.  It's convenient and it has a storage bag so you don't have bands all of the room.  My favorite exercise is the overhead press - you have to use your stabilizing muscles to keep it steady.  My only complaint is that the handles feel like they are made of cardboard.  I don't mind it too much, but it would have been nice to have a more sturdy handle.  Overall, I think this is great for anyone trying to get in shape.",2
"I had never really used lifting bands before buying them, but i seen them in a few of my workout videos and decided to make the purchase. These Black mountain lifting bands have 5 colors starting pretty easily, that get more stiff as you move up. When you get to #5, you can add the #1 to it to create #6. Some huge beast might be able to use 3 or 4 bands together to create a massive rubber resistant band but it would be very awkward to use.  In all, i would totally buy these again if my get lost and i'll recommend them to friends if they ask where i got mine.",2
"These bands are made of strong, high-quality material. And I like the door attachments. But I'm 6-1 and find the bands too short. However, there is a workaround. To increase the band length, simply add a carabiner in between the handle and the band. Also, the color-coding is confusing. Instead, they should label the bands from 1 to 5.",2
"I love this set of exercise bands.  I purchased them on a recommendation from my personal trainer for use when I stay at hotels without a full gym.  Any hotel room with a door will allow me to do 90% of the exercises I normally do.  All these bands roll up into a nice bag for travel and the whole kit is fairly lightweight.  I think the lighter gauge bands are pretty useless for strength training unless you are a petite woman, child, or doing some rehabilitative work.  I'm not exactly sure who uses a 2lb band.  Maybe for stretching?  But the red and black bands are heavier gauge and excellent for male strength training.  There are a lot of reviews here on Amazon complaining that the bands eventually wear-out or break.  They are supposed to.  They stretch and, after repeated stretching, yes, they will wear out.  Good.  That means you are using them and your muscles are getting a workout.  Quit whining.  Buy a few more replacement bands.  Wear them out too.  The company that makes these bands appears pretty solid.  In the package I received, there was a coupon for a free extra orange band which was even a heavier gauge than the black band.  I'm looking forward to receiving it, and I think the company offering it at no charge was a very nice touch.",2
"This product is excellent. The bands are great and I like the door anchor as well. The company is excellent. They shipped quickly and I had a small issue with one of the handles and I set an email inquiring if I had an recourse, keep in mind I've had these bands for 6 months now, and they replied with just asking for my address and the exact product. I received them two days later at no cost to me, either for the replacement handle or the shipping costs which I feel is outstanding. The only question asked was my address.  The bands themselves are great and you can combine them for an even better workout. I can't really speak to the ankle strap as I don't really use them for that purpose but the bands themselves are excellent as is the customer service.  You can not go wrong with purchasing these.",2

I especially like the high quality metal clips on the ends of the bands. The design is nice too -- it allows the bands to be combined for different resistance levels. Customer service was very good when I called the company. I am very satisfied.",2
"This was my first time using resistance band training. These bands are good quality. If you are going to switch between exercises that need different levels of resistance, I would suggest purcahsing an extra set of handles&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Mountain-Resistance-band-Handles/dp/B0050IFOEO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Mountain Resistance band Handles</a>&nbsp;They allow you to use to sets of bands and switch between them faster.  I do with the heavist of the bands (red / orange) could be longer. I do some exercises that require standing in the middle of the band and there is just not enough length (or strength from me) to extend as far as I should.  Overall, great.",2
This product exceeds expectations. Incredible value and quality.  Fast shipping.  You can combine tubes on one handgrip due to the quick releases at the end of each tube. Great idea to be able to customize your resistance.  My physical therapist wanted to sell me a single tube to continue my exercises at home and he charges 5 X as much for just the tube itself!  Buy this item!,2
"I have used these resistance bands sporadically, at best.  I generally only take these on vacation to help be consistent with my exercise routine.  Two have failed at the attachment end (to the handle).  The first was the heavy yellow and today the red.  If you have never broken an elastic exercise band, let me tell you; it hurts.  Even the small diameter bands can cause a great deal of pain.  Will try other manufacturer.",2
"These are definitely worth the very reasonable price tag. They work perfectly when tied against a bed, dresser, or door. It's very easy to change out the bands (fast clips) and when you combine the bands in the order they suggest (included resistance pamphlet) you really do get a good deal of resistance.  My one complaint is that the bands are a little longer than  I would have liked. I know many bands allow you to hold them hand to hand around your back and do push-ups with added resistance or other chest exercises. I'm not a small guy and these bands are too long for me to get any resistance hand to hand around my back. It's not a big complaint, more of an annoyance and I guess the length has it's purpose somewhere else.  These bands are durable, have comfortable handles, include a door and poll mount and a carrying bag. These are a great bargain, and still worth it.",2
"Product is as-described/pictured.  Was a little less strength than I thought (but that's my own fault for just not being familiar with resistance bands in general). Still should work alright for basic excersises and toning.  BUT... BUT BUT BUT... I hate being tall. 6'2"". These bands are not reeeally for us taller guys. YES, you can use 'em and I guess get the same effects....ish. But you'll face resistance sooner in your motions than other average-lengthed individuals. I also tend to have orangatang-lengthed arms. Like a freakin' pteradactyl. Again, these bands are not designed for us. You'll face resistance sooner in your motions, and thus you'll have to use lesser-than-other-anticipated weighted-bands and just do more reps to get the same effect. This logically means stressing the bands more (though I've only used mine a few times, and thus haven't witnessed this yet and so am only theorizing based on the feel of the bands when I use them and my gut feeling).  BUT: They're well-built. GREAT price. And come with neat little carrying pouch and instructions for about 10 excersises. I just wish their directions gave more explanation (or visual depiction of your body) as to which muscles each excersise is supposed to workout (primary, secondary).  All-in-all, great product for great price. If I were an average-sized human, I'd probably have given it a 5-star.",2
"I'm about 5'10"" or 5'11""ish and I'd say the quality of this resistance bands are pretty ok (since this is my first resistance bands set). It's just kinda short, but it's still good.  Dec 5, 2014: Been using this for at least twice a month (have gym membership, so just using this for ghetto workout). So far, it still works well. Nothing has snapped.",2
Based on the number of positive reviews I purchased these bands. They provided adequate resistance and I enjoyed it for the few weeks they lasted. Eventually the bands started bursting from the black fabric points. Apparently there is a small ball in the bands that hold it in place. four of my bands broke at that point. That is definitely a weakness in the manufacturing process. I haven't seen any cracks on the other parts of the bands.,2
"These bands are portable and are good for certain motions that are more difficult to replicate using free weights (I'm using them to strengthen my draw for archery).  Straps, handles and bands feel sturdy and well constructed.",2
If you are interested in resistance bands or tubes I highly recommend this set.  Very good quality and I enjoy these more than when I would use my 'bands'. The set comes with everything you need. I also recommend 'The Great Resistance Tubing Handbook' by Noel Potvin. It's cheap and has excellent photos that cover various exercises.,2
"I was looking for resistance bands to help with strength and conditioning for taekwondo.  These really fit my needs quite well since the package comes with a door attachment and ankle strap that allows me to train without a partner.  The tubes clip to the handles/ankle strap/door attachment with spring loaded clips rather than just sliding into some fitted slot, and they seem very secure.  I wasn't too sure I would like the metal clips at first, but they are very secure.  I've not seen the door attachment on other products, but this accessory is pretty slick, at least for my purposes.  Rather than attach to the doorknob or under the door, the attachment consists of a nylon strap with a ball inserted into one end.  The strap is then inserted between the door jamb and the door and is secured in place when you close the door.  What makes this work so well for me is that I can adjust the height of the anchor; low for kicking drills and higher for hand techniques.  The variety of tubing is also more useful than I thought.  I had anticipated needing only one heavy band for my training, but my 8 year old son and wife also like the bands and use lower resistance than I do.  All in all, a very neat little package for the price.",2
"This product was exactly as described in both the photo and written statement.  Frequently I buy things and they are nothing like the picture or the description of the  item's virtues are over stated.  In this case you will be getting what is described for a lot less than the ""As-Seen-On-TV"" products.  The only thing that was a bummer about this product was the wait.  As an Amazon prime member I'm not used to waiting for stuff but the set was out of stock so I had to wait two weeks.  Other than that it was a really great deal and goes quite well with my p90x.",2
I purchased the Black Mountain Resistance Band Set based on the positive reviews I've read here on the product and the customer service. Fortunately I have not had to use the customer service. But the product is as advertised. I wanted to hold off on writing the review until I got to use the bands for a little while. I have been using it for my P90X workouts along with dumbbells and it has performed flawlessly. The quality of the bands are excellent and when you think about the cost it is a real bargain. Rarely does a product exceed my expectations but this one has. I highly recommend these bands.,2
"the bands are great the services is great, when can you make a call  and get the owner on the phone what more could you ask for, great bands  great price great services that saids it all",2
I have had this band set now for a few weeks and I have to say they are a great way to avoid getting fat while working as a driver. During my down time instead of watching movies and playing games I decided to try these and with a lil will power and these bands I get a nice workout in the bus and also in hotel rooms. Made very well great purchase!!,2
Great product for less cost than in stores.  I have been using with P90X for about two weeks and am satisfied.,2
"So far so good!  Also, the company has outstanding customer service and even sent us a free band just for placing our original order and calling them.  The handles are comfortable. There is a good variety of band tensions to select from and the additional accessories are a bonus; not to mention the carrying case.  I highly recommed this product.",2
"I have always been wary of resistance bands because I've heard so many horror stories of bands being made poorly and people getting hurt badly when they break. However, after reading the great reviews on these, I decided to try them out. By the end of my first workout I was no longer afraid. It is quite obvious how well they are made. Others that I've used can't even compare. The door anchor and ability to attach more than one band to a single, sturdy handle only adds to their awesomeness. And in case this wasn't all awesome enough, I ordered them 6:30am on a Tuesday and had them Wednesday afternoon!! The very next day!",2
"I bought these bands to use with Tony Horton's 10-Minute Trainer.  For the most part these are great until you have to do a military press or an overhead tricep curl.  These exercises require you to stand on the middle of the band and push all the way up until your arms are fully extended.  For these exercises, the bands are too short for me and I worry how long they'll last if I keep stretching them that far.  I'm 6'0"" tall, so someone shorter might not have any problem.  If you're 6' or taller, I would find something longer because these will disappoint.  The B-Line bands used by Tony Horton for P90x and his other videos appear to be roughly twice as long as these.  These are good quality bands though.  The grommets are strong and the clips are metal and thus, less prone to breaking.  The door attachment and ankle accessory work fine.  The ""instruction manual"" is a little sparse and simplistic but you can't expect too much there.  Suspiciously, I noticed that none of the exercises show the bands being lifted any higher than shoulder length.  EDIT: I increased my review to a 4 star after using the bands a while longer and speaking to their customer service.  I also got a free orange band for my call.  According to customer service the bands can actually stretch safely up to 5 times their original size  (their max stretch is about 40 ft. although this makes them unusable).  After 3 weeks of overhead use they still show no signs of wear or tear.  EDIT: Still on the fence about these.  After 6 weeks of use I had to get the red band replaced after seeing several tears appear.  Now I'm seeing tears in the black band and one tear in the new red band already.  As far as I know I'm not using them inappropriately but I may have to go ahead and return the whole set.",2
I was a bit skeptical about exercise bands having never tried them. But my trainer at the YMCA thought it would be a good change along with my dumbbell set at home. So I read a lot of product reviews and these were rated highly by people. I like them. I printed off a ton of exercises my trainer gave me and am learning how to do each one. I do wonder if the bands couldn't be longer as the set at my YMCA is considerably so but I guess I get the same workout. I am still playing around with what color (or weight resistance) to use for each exercise. And if I travel on vacation I can take them with me which is cool. So far I have had absolutely no problem with any of the bands - they all seem to be high quality and durable. Let's see where I stand 2 months from now.,2
"I ordered these based on the good reviews and have not been disappointed.  The resistance bands themselves are well-constructed and seem to be very durable.  I have only had them for a few days, but their quality construction is impressive and I believe that they will provide high performance for an extended time period.  I am very pleased with this purchase and would not hesitate to buy additional merchandise from Black Mountain Products.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Black-Mountain-Products-Resistance-Band-Set-with-Door-Anchor-Ankle-Strap-Exercise-Chart-and-Resistance-Band-Carrying-Case/dp/7245456313/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Black Mountain Products Resistance Band Set with Door Anchor, Ankle Strap, Exercise Chart, and Resistance Band Carrying Case</a>",2
"I received the bands and immediately began using them in conjunction with P90X.  They provide the perfect alternative to free weights and the portability gives you the flexibility to use them where ever and when ever.  I would highly recommend these bands to everyone!  They are also very durable, so you can really go hard with no worriees.",2
We recently purchased these bands to use with P90X. This is a great product at a very good price. Quality construction using quality materials. The bands stand up well to the rigourous demands of P90X. I would highly recommend this resistance bands set.,2
"Compared to other brands, where each band is its own resistance, here you can combine multiple bands to increase your resistance as you need it. That was a huge plus for me. The little accessories like the detachable ankle strap and door anchor are great add ons, and on top of that there is a nice little bag to keep them all organized.  I have just had them for a short period of time, but look forward to using them alot.",2
"The band's came on time and as described.  I have been using the bands 6 days a week for over a month now and did not want to write a review until I had a chance to break the product in.  I am impressed at the overall construction of the bands and there are no visible signs of break down of the material even after continual use.  I would and actually have recommend these bands to anyone looking to purchase resistance bands.  Also, their customer service was outstanding when I called to inquirer about higher resistance bands.  Quality product!",2
"After having had these bands for a couple of weeks, I can attest to their quality. Compared with others I've used, the build quality is excellent and solid. The accessories are well made. I had a question about the warranty, and was able to speak with a customer service representative in minutes, and he was helpful and friendly. I really don't think you could do better for anywhere near the price. Nice job.",2
"I use it for working out at home and its very good. It's a great thing to use when you're not able to go to the gym and lift weights and also for phyiscal therapy. its very light, easy to store, and carry. you can do various exercises. I highly recommend this product to anyone who loves to work out",2
"Better than I expected, way better!  These Bands are by far one of the best small investments I have made in fitness equipment.  I have years of weight lifting and working out and have finally found equipment that answers issue of how to travel and keep working out.  Price: This product is worth twice what I paid for it. So for the cost of a month at a gym I now have a gym in my travel bag! Durability:  Stronger and and more rugged than I expected (and I have hi expectations) Flaws :  NONE! (but I will keep trying to find one) Design:  Clips are flawless, connections strong, handles good, multiple bands combinations is genius! Resistance:  I am a serious weight lifter.  These were able to take me to failure and kick my butt! (Also able to figure out ways to do cardio type workouts with lighter resistance bands and hi rep exercises) Versatile:  yes, very  I took this set on a trip to the Bahamas living on a boat.  Used them daily.  The variety of combinations gave great versatility to fine tune each exercise to my specific needs and strength.  I could wrap the bands over the main boom, around winches, around the mast, and just experiment and try different things.  Kept the workouts interesting and fun.  Imagine doing a weight workout on a pristine white beach with the crystal blue ocean in front of you in a balmy breeze in the shade of palm trees!  (yea it doesnt get much better than that!)  Results:  no rust on metal parts in a continuos salt water environment, no wear or stretch marks on the bands, nothing broke or even showed signs of fatigue, no loss of resistance in the bands.  Three of us used them and they got over two hours of use every day.  This set is perfect for travelers or people who have down time at work and can set aside a little time for a quick workout on the fly.  Fireman, Police officers, outdoor workers, office workers, medical professionals.  Think about having 15 to 20 minutes of spare time and being able to pull a gym out of your black bag and and do a quick workout.  Pretty cool concept!!  for those who have broken bands be careful not to tye knots in the bands or wrap them around sharp or rough objects.  that will wear them out or tear them quickly.  Common sense rules!  Also call the company.  They will openly discuss their products and listen to criticism.  They are very customer friendly!  (disclaimer: I am not associated with, payed by, related to, or in any way connected to the manufacturer.  This is an honost review)",2
Have used the product and I mainly use them for travel or not feeling lik egoing outside.  My son can use them which is great because he is too young to use actual weights.,2
I used to be a personal trainer and I needed something to fill in on the days I couldn't make it to the gym.  This was great quality esp for the cash,2
"So.... these are great. Whatever you do, make sure you get a number of bands (just like this set!)  When I started P90X I used just one braided Reebok resistance band, because I didn't think I'd need multiple different resistance strengths. I was wrong. Certain exercises were too light, no matter how big I made the loop, and certain exercises too heavy, even with no loop. The problem, especially with making a really big loop, is that you overstretch the band and before you know it, it tears. Mine tore within 2 months.  The BMP set, however, is great. I use all five bands, from the lightest one (yellow) for straight arm shoulder flies to a combination of the heaviest ones (red and black) for bicep curls. Speaking of which, this is a really clever system that allows you to use multiple bands in one exercise, so you can create your own weight. Really smart. The door hook anchor is also cleverly made, with no metal parts, so if for some reason your door isn't strong enough, at least no metal will be flying in the direction of your face.  The only thing I would do is call BMP before they ship your stuff, and ask them if you could order an extra set of handles to be shipped along with your order. It makes switching between bands (and therefore between exercises) so much easier! And the staff of BMP is super friendly and nice about it.  Enjoy your workout with these!",2
"I got these bands as I did not want to spend a lot of money and I also wanted high quality bands to do P90X with. These are perfect as they allow stacking of multiple bands on the handles. Theres a large variety with great quality. I probably won't use the door anchor or strap but only because I have no current use for them. The price of these should be double but for what it is at now I would not wait to scoop these up. Oh and for those that are gunna do P90x... I highly suggest the bands for the range of motion you get and also the portability of them.  A+ Product BMP, Good Job!",2
"I purchased these bands to use with P90X.  They seem to be well made - I did not feel like they were going to break while I was using them.  The handle can slip making them a bit uncomfortable to use, but that doesn't prevent them from doing the job.  I had never used bands before, but they were much cheaper than buying more dumbells....after a while, I decided I liked the dumbells better.  However; these are GREAT for when I am traveling and want to workout on the road.  I would highly recommend taking a Sharpie Marker and writing on each band the resistance level because unless you use them everyday, you won't remember which band is which.",2
"Received as a gift and am very happy with the product thus far. I used them during P90X workouts and find that the various color combinations give me the needed resistance. Just hope they last a long time, no concerns yet.",2
"Great bands.  As a free weight lifter myself 5 days a week I needed something to take with me traveling.  Pros: 1. bands are very durable 2. hooks on bands are great. 3. enough weight for the average to slightly above average lifter for 10-12 reps 4. Great for the money and beginner (even with a new door anchor) 5. Compact bag is great that holds everything.  Easily fits in even the most packed suitcase.  No excuse for not working out while traveling anymore.  Cons: 1. The material they use for the handles are very rough (not the part you hold onto but that holds the handles and hooks). For intense lifting scraped knuckle raw.  With gloves you will be more then good. 2. The door anchor is a joke! Number 1 complaint by far. Highly recommend you purchase an additional one for 10-12 dollars more with a big base. Trust me if the door is even slightly looser it will snapped back and it hurts! This was a hotel solid door that it snapped back so not even a hollow inside home door. And yes I double and triple checked that it was solid behind the door but when you are doing multiple reps and pulling at full resistance the door anchor can move to the wrong position. 3. They use a half moon ring for the handles for the bands to snap onto. A little annoying cause it will not stay in place. A round ring would work better.  Ultimately this is a great set, minus the door anchor, for the money. I would highly recommend them for anybody looking for a portable gym. With my travels, hotels only provide treadmills typically but the lifter is left out.  Great way to keep up with your workout or mix it up.  It can be a fun way to workout also if free weights are unavailable or you do not have a spotter.  Again BEWARE of the door anchor!  With exception of the door anchor the other cons are not that big of a deal. Just being detailed, by no means urging you against these since they are very good for the price.",2
very nice for the price not high end quality but it will get the job done in a storm not recommended for long period of use but enough for the occasional user,2
"These claim to be ""fog proof"" Hmm! I wonder what that foggy stuff is when I wore these outdoors?",2
"I'm a bit disappointed of the size of this thing. Too small for a grown up to use .   Blade isn't that sharp but can easily be remedied with a whetstone .   Overall, this is a perfect back up weapon but will be my last resort .",2
This is for all of u saying its 2 small because it's supposed to be unnoticed in combat as it looks like u just have a closed fist. It about wear u place the knife on the opponents body.,2
"its a cute little knife. but it is even smaller than it seems like in the photo. I wanted a super small karambit similar to some of the hidden karambits used traditionally. While the blade is just where I want it to be the handle is so small that it makes the whole affair a joke. There is no way to get a four finger grip on this thing, and I have small girly hands. Also the ring is so small as to make it not possible to get the ring over anything but the first two phalanx of the finger. It makes for a cute little utility knife only. Something cool for a small person learning about knives would be an ok use for it.  *** I had to revise my statement. This thing is a piece of junk. It is even too small even for some children's hands. There is no good use for this thing at all. It is a waste of steel.",2
Love this little blade..it is little and I can wear it inside my shirt and nobody notices..,2
"My kit arrived with parts missing. Everything was in disarray, with just a few parts resting in their spots. After inspecting it and putting everything back where it belongs, I opted to send it back. The parts feel chintzy and overall looks like a cheap  kit. I didn't even try to use it...just packed it up and sent it back. What a disappointment.",2
"Excellent kit with all you need for your pistols, rifles and shotguns, except the chemicals. 5 more words required, bla bla bla.",2
i bought this cleaning kit to keep in my car when i go to the range.comes in very handy for a quick cleaning at the range,2
This has everything you need for every gun. Plus stuff you might never use. Looks like it will be good for all guns and years of use.,2
"This is a a great kit and has most of what you need. However the platic in my inside came warped, and the handle lock in so firmly you have to yank them to get them out.",2
"LOVE this cleaning kit! PRICED with Quality.... works for all pistols and rifles, even older vintage ones.",2
For the price it is a very nice kit. Just finished using it for the first time.,2
This is a product that has a lot of options.  However for the price I paid I do not think that the product was worth it.  Many of the items are wearable/consumable and I'd recommend just buying the individual component for the caliber that you're cleaning.,2
Low quality cleaning kit.  All the pieces seam cheap and flimsy,2
Product is great and as described. Arrived quicker than expected. Used kit to clean pistols rifles and shotguns.,2
This is a great kit for the price and the case helps keep the supplies organized.,2
"i would recommend this kit because it has everything to clean all my calibers, is portable and encased",2
"This 62 piece gun cleaning comes with copper brushes and mops of all sizes ti ft any caliber handgun, rifle and shotgun.  It does work great and you can eye which item you need to clean your firearm because the items in the cleaning kit are not marked for what caliber that it is for.  It is not a deal breaker but it would be nice if it was labeled.  Other wise a must have for cleaning.",2
"Nice assortment of cleaning tools, but the main cleaning rod broke at the plastic handle on the first use. Just OK.",2
"This product came with everything it advertised. I did have a bit of a problem, but they made good on the sale.",2
I am extremely disappointed in this gun cleaning kit. The first time I used it the plastic cloth holders broke off inside the gun rods. Absolutely the worst gun cleaning kit I have ever seen. What a waste of money. I will never buy an Outers product again. I bought an Otis kit after using this and very happy with the Otis kit.,2
4 stars because I've never found the perfect cleaning kit and for stars because it is closest I've come to perfect,2
Very compct with everything you need in one place.  I had many cleaning peices before but they were scattered all over the place and never to be found when I needed them.  This kit solves that problem.,2
Piece of crap. The black push rod handle cracked in half the first time I used it and the copper bristles fall out of the pieces. Lots of sizes to use but what's the point when they are all low quality garbage,2
"The plastic components are not sturdy at all. The smallest cleaning rod tip broke on the first use and the threads are now embedded in the smallest rod, rendering that gauge useless.",2
"Especially the smaller ones, they break really easily. Oh well, the rest of it seems to work just fine. I'll probably buy a different one after all the plastic tips have broken.",2
This is my first cleaning kit.  So glad I went with this one.  Has everything I need and some.  I previously had a otis kit but don't think i'll be using that anymore.,2
My husband needed this for all his rifles for hunting especially . He loved this thanks it's not as cheap as we thought it was going to be when it arrived,2
"Like: Very large selection of items for most caliber fire arms. Contents seem to be made well.  Dislike: Case is not the quality that I expected, seems cheaply made (flimsy).",2
"This is an awesome kit.  The price is unbeatable, the quality of the kit is unmatched and the delivery was quick.  I got this right to work for my crew to use.  I would recommend this to anyone looking for a durable and complete kit for any type of firearms cleaning.",2
"Most notable is that it doesn't contain everything you might need and it is missing some calibers that are not entirely uncommon --- there is no provision for .40 for example.  The individual components are not made of the strongest materials, but then you don't have to worry about any of them damaging your rifling. It is a really nice size overall and the container is pretty good. Some items may shake loose into other parts of the case, but they never fall out entirely. The extra room between some of the items is also pretty good for storing hex keys and what-not.  The lid latches very securely on both sides and the rods snap very securely easily in and out on the top. Everything in the bottom is loose.  Not the cleaning kit for the connoisseur; but a nice economic kit for the hobbyist that has guns in a number of different common calibers. Pretty good for under $30.  (Also, the shotgun mops and brushes are actually on opposite sides from the picture; obviously not a big deal and since they are the same size they can pretty much be re-arranged but the mops are actually bigger and have slightly larger slots in the middle. If you try to make it match the picture then the mops might smoosh a little)  Complete list of contents:  Thin rod set (for .17 and .22) Freely rotating brass rod with handle - rod length 8"" 10.5"" extension x2 (28"" fully assembled useable length)  Thick rod set Freely rotating brass rod with handle -rod length 8"" 10.5"" extension x2 (28"" fully assembled useable length)  Thin rod to thick rod adapter (required for the .22) you could possibly use the thick rods to clean a 22 but it would bump against the edges of the barrel for sure. Adapter is aluminum so not incredibly tough.  Thick to super-thick adapter (for the shotgun cleaning brushes and mops, screws into the thick rod)  Brushes .17 .22 .27 .30 .38 (useable for 9mm) .45 410 shotgun (marked 41) 20 gauge shotgun 12 gauge shotgun  Mops .22 .35 (useable for 9mm) 410 shotgun (arguably useable for a .45?) 20 gauge shotgun 12 gauge shotgun  Patch loops .22 410 (marked 410S)  Jags (the pointy things that push patches a bit better than the loops). They are plastic and vulnerable to being pushed too hard if you push them sideways on accident. .17 .22 .27 .30 .35 (works great for my 9mm) .45  Also got the following products to round out my kit:  Brushes (stored separately) http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00162OKDY/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i03?ie=UTF8&psc=1  Picks (stored separately) http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0048KGFHU/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1  2 oz Solvent (stored in one of the front round compartments) http://www.amazon.com/Hoppes-No-Solvent-Ounce-Bottle/dp/B000PW21T6/ref=sr_1_8?s=sporting-goods&ie=UTF8&qid=1361160571&sr=1-8&keywords=hoppe%27s+no.+9+solvent  Cleaning Patches (stored in the other front round compartment --- I don't think anything larger than 1-1/2"" would fit) http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B008F9MLF0/ref=oh_details_o05_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1  14.9 ml Gun Oil (stored in the back middle compartment - where the rectangle patches are shown; the precision tip hangs over into the small brush area by just a little and doesn't interfere with closure at all) http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0013R67A6/ref=oh_details_o04_s00_i02?ie=UTF8&psc=1",2
"the copper rods are very good quality, so as the copper brushes. the plastic spear is very soft and easy to bend. so, be careful. overall, great kit.",2
A decent add on kit to add to all the kits I have been buying from the 60's. Most tips are metal and used the plastic ones carefully and they are so far working well. For the price per part it is a good kit to have if you have many different guns to clean.,2
Everything you need in 1 convenient kit. Plus compartments in the bottom to add odds and ends that aren't part of the kit. I use this all the time and it's everything I think I'll need to clean any gun,2
"This kit is really 32 pieces. The wipes were only counted as 1 piece, not like another one that I purchased for my son, It said 78 pieces and it actually was 39 because they counted 50 wipes in there as 50.",2
GOOD OVERALL KIT BUT I THOUGHT ROD TIP WOULD HAVE SLOT FOR CLEANING PAD.,2
"You could spend a whole lot more, but this little kit delivers quality, compactness, and covers many calibers and gauges of firearm at a great price.  The plastic jags are pretty flimsy, sombe careful one doesnt snap off on you inside a barrel or worse barrel/chamber of a SA pistol.",2
"Awesome price and packaging to hold everything we need to clean our varying model pistols, rifles, and shotgun.",2
"once I deleted some of the parts I didn't need it has everything I need for a AR , AK, and a 9mm.",2
Bought this because I was given 2 rifles and a 410 shot gun.....came on time and I was pleased with the set for the cost of it not expecting to get much. Long story short......Cleaned all the guns 4 hrs...lol.......and was pleased at the assortment of brushes that fit each individual gun.....270 win..410 Savage....Savage 22 LR....and my 12 gage....great for the price and cleans all my hand guns too!.....would buy again! Cheers Tim South East Alaska!,2
Happy with product other than the plastic patch holders. They are very supple  and bend easily when trying to push through barrel.,2
Very nice brass collection. These rods are not aluminum which break easily for me.,2
Great price. Keeps everything in one place for cleaning all calibers of guns.,2
"Decent kit for the price.  Quality on par with the usual bubble kits you get at big box stores, except you get about 15 kits in one case (and the rods are brass).  There IS a .40 (same as the .45 brush).  Here is the list of brush sizes (each brush is marked)  17-cal,  22-cal,  270-cal,  30-cal,  9mm/38-cal,  40-45-cal/10mm,  410-ga,  20/28-ga,  10/12-ga.",2
"Amazon product information states ""Origin: USA"", but the package is clearly labeled ""Made in China.""  I would not have purchased if it was accurately described, and I always ask if the origin isn't shown in the Amazon information.  Except for the lone .17 caliber bore brush, the adapters and the collars/bosses of the bore brushes and cotton bore mops are aluminum, which can scratch bluing and steel barrels (the aluminum-oxide exterior film on all aluminum alloy is much harder than gun barrel steel); brass is MUCH preferred.  It's really odd since the cleaning rods themselves are solid brass.  But now that I look closely, I can see in the photo that the collars are aluminum. <sigh>.  Two stars for false ""Origin: USA"".  Don't support Communist tyrants!",2
use it for all my pistol cleaning and i get a lot of requests to borrow it.,2
Very pleased with this kit. I'm using it for occasional cleaning. It seems to be constructed well.,2
Everything is working just fine so far.  Have only used it a couple times to clean a pistol.  I like the case and extra places to store the smaller bottles.  Item: Outers Universal 32-Piece Blow Molded Gun Cleaning Kit,2
"I'm surprised this kit doesn't have better reviews. The case is pretty solid, as are the cleaning rods. It comes with all the brushes you'd ever need for the average gun owner. The first thing I cleaned with this kit is a rusty, old, Mosin Nagant I'm trying to restore and it worked great. People on here have be complaining about how brushes and rods have come loose in their firearms as they were cleaning. I'm sorry, but I can't help but to think that's user error. If this cleaning kit can tackle an old Nagant, it can handle anything else.",2
"Has about everything you need to keep your guns clean. Sturdy case, but the plastic hinge is not durable. Most all brushes and rods a well built and should last a long time.",2
"My regular gun cleaning kit is the size of a foot locker and too bulky to take on trips in a small car. So I wanted something more transportable. This is a nice kit, it's got everything the average shooter would need with multiple calibers. There's even a couple spots inside for other things. One holds Hoppes #9 quite well but I can't get the bottle of gun oil to fit in it. Still I would recommend this for home or travel.",2
This is a great little kit that provides everything you need to take care of your handgun except the oil.  You won't be disappointed with this product.,2
These kits are amazing if you have multiple guns and calibers to clean.  It has everything you need in terms of brushes and jags.  I also buy these to refill my larger unit since it is cheaper ordering it this way than individual brushes and rods.,2
"I bought this from Walmart for the same price as Amazon. On my first use, the cleaning rod broke at the extension point and the plastic handle came off on the other one. I will never buy anything with Outers written on it. I am buying individual parts from Tipton and other reputable manufacturers to make my own cleaning kit.",2
Run of the mill cleaning kit I bought as a gift for my brother-in-law.  Of course he has a .32 caliber pistol so I had to buy a separate brush.  A basic kit that will suit most anybody's cleaning needs.,2
"Wow! This is a great battery for the money. Doesn't have any issues with my charger and seems to run fine. I will tell all my friends about these inexpensive, But good batteries. Enjoy!!!  11-30-07 I think I paid $33 and now I see that it sells for $41. Still working well, but I wish the price hadn't gone up...",2
Great for wrapping wires into a clean bundle - highly recommended.,2
"It works perfectly for my application, which was a bike rack hitch bolt.",2
"Love these, they get a good laugh when we hang them on our camper",2
"Excellent value, better than the original parts that came with my $1100 grill, no BS. Measure carefully to properly identify the correct parts and you won't be disappointed.",2
Daughter LOVES it. Nice and light. May not last over a year but for that price who cares.,2
"Have bought two of these now. They are very sturdy, and by using just the two screws that are included I feel comfortable hanging everything on them.  The optional colors are very nice, I just wish I could see them more... because my coats and backpack conceal it.",2
"Worked for what I needed it for. Currently fused to oil filter cup tool so I don't have to break out my 1/2"" drive for oil changes.",2
This Hitachi 2-stroke engine oil will keep my Hitachi RB24EAP happy & running strong for quite awhile.  When I begin to run low I will happily buy it again.  Thanks Amazon!,2
Found a few defective ones but I guess that's to be expected.,2
Convenient packaging and reasonable pricing. No problems with performance in my chainsaw and string trimmers.,2
"I may eventually purchase this for my son if the price goes down. I already know the quality isn't going to be the greatest because they had this at iplay America. My son really wanted it but he needed 3,000 points at the arcade and wouldn't give it to him for the 400 points he had.  It's not worth the 20 dollars. It's also not full it's more on the flat side. As of now we just received the animated one that was on sale for $10 and it's great! More realistic looking.",2
"Having connectors at both ends of a trailer wiring harness only allowing the use of a split covering. This worked great, easy to apply and stays in place. Just be careful when cutting it, better if you use a hot knife.",2
"I use utility blades. a lot. ... Of all the utility knives, this is my favorite to carry around. Collapses small, extends to standard size, has a belt clip. Unfortunately, these are difficult to find. If you see them, buy them up. Made in USA. Right on.",2
"If the basis of our review is how much our little one still likes this teether, then it's a 5 star rating. This the one she reaches for if they're all out in front of her. The Crab ""legs"" are perfect for her little teething gums. AND she's learning that she's going to love crab legs early!",2
"This one is definitely a favorite of mine the art work is incredible a lot of detail put on to such a small space. This Zippo isn't just a Zippo. This is a piece of art. It is actually in my ""Do not use"" Zippo collection. (To clarify I have a ""Do not use"" collection and a separate collection of Zippos I use.)",2
My daughter has recently gotten into the Barbie Princess Super Power movie and loves this lunch box.  She is three years old and starting preschool this year.  She can't wait to bring it to school.  She is already carrying it around.  It seems to be good quality so I think it will hold up for the year!,2
"These are wonderful trapazoid and Isosceles triangles that work with my grandson's Magformers.  The ability to buy more sizes is really helpful when you are trying to make a bridge or other creation that are not included in a preset package such as dinosaurs, etc.  My four year old grandson loves to play with these and make all kinds of shapes not listed in the sample books encuded in the magformer sets.",2
"Nice addition to the existing collection. It works well with the other magformers tiles. I wish they sold more loose pieces. A bit expensive for a toy, but then my kids love it so don't feel that bad spending the money.",2
My daughter loves Abby from Sesame Street so I ordered these hats for her birthday party. They fit nicely on young children's heads as well as adult's. They were a little expensive but it is very hard to find Abby party supplies so it was worth it to see the look on my daughter's face when she saw these.,2
I love my sunflower curtain! The color is a purplish grey! Cool design!,2
