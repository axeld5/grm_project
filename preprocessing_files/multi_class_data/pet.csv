I purchased this cd for my Pocket Parrot. It has both a woman and a man speaking. Pet store recommends to buy a female voice Only on bird cds because birds respond to female voice better. Con: there's some real stupid things said on this CD. Prefer female voice because pet shop recommends female voice. Pros: it's cheap. I will review again in 6 months see if my Polly picks up few words.,3
"Maybe it's just my Amazon parrot, but she's not picking up very quickly or very well.",3
"I bought this to help me teach my blue quaker named Booger to talk and it sure has helped. I put it in the CD player and let it play all day while I am at work. It might drive Booger nuts, but he sure has learned a lot of words.",3
Didn't do a thing for my African Grey! He hated it and it was very obnoxious!!,3
I like it - but the Cockatiel I am not so sure - he listens but so far does not speak.,3
"This is a CD. I should have read better, I was expecting a DVD.",3
my parot loves this CD! started repeating the phrases after a week of listening.,3
I was reLly disappointed the cd has a lot of sayings that are really stupid. I was looking for one that repeats the same saying like six times in a row. Not all the unnecessary saying.,3
It does not contain many words that we would want our bird to incorporate into his repetoire.........description of item not extensive enough.  Shipment and transaction were handled professionally.,3
"Very fast service. My parrots are still not saying anything new, but I will continue to use it with the hope that after many repetitions they will pick up some more words.",3
"If you want your bird to interact with you, then interact with your bird. Parrots have the mental capacity of a 3-5 year old child. This is like plopping your child down in front of the TV and calling it quality time. Parrots learn to communicate dynamically not by rote. I have 5 parrots and all are chatty because we chat, while cleaning, cooking, doing laundry.. whatever. Turn off the TV and read aloud, talk, sing, dance.. be one of the flock.",3
"Really like this CD. You can choose to repeat whatever phrase you want your bird to say. Or just play the entire CD. Wish some of the phrases provided included the word ""parakeet"" since it includes others such as cockatiel or parrot.",3
"This is the biggest waste of money - do not buy it - it will not work!  It's just people saying a certain word, then a 10 second pause ... then a different word and another 10 second pause.  You can create your own if you really want to try this.  But you really should not leave this on for your bird all day - it should be done in 10 minute intervals only or your bird may get irritated by it (i know i get irritated by it after only 2 words).  Don't waste your money on this.",3
"seriously, buy a tape recorder and just play it continuously to your bird. at least then, it will be your own voice he's hearing and not just some random person saying 'hello' over and and over again. i'm sure repitition is good for them to learn, but i paid $11.99 for this? the entire cd is made up of random words or phrases all about 3-5 seconds long. the idea is to choose the one you want your bird to learn and then put the that track of the cd on repeat. it makes sense, but really, couldn't you do it yourself for free? also, alot of the words are things i wouln't want him to learn anyway, just random stuff you wouldn't normally even say yourself.",3
"My impressions of Fatherree's book:  Pros --  -- The photos are almost without exception beautiful and help to explain and illustrate points the author is trying to make.  -- Chapter 6 (""Tridacnid troubles) sets out a good amount of information on diseases that I have never seen in any other place.  -- The third chapter, on identification of the various species, is very useful, clear and well done overall.  The photos in this chapter are invaluable and beautiful.  Cons --  -- The ""conversational style"" is something a reader may like, or may not. I did not.  I want a clear explanation of a topic, not a conversation with someone who is trying to be casual, witty and amusing for reasons that don't help the explanation along.  The author is apparently trying, in part, to make the book entertaining enough so that the reader wants to learn about the subject; virtually anyone who buys this book, though, already has enough interest in the subject to sustain them through the reading of the book.  -- The text on pages 130 and 131 is juxtaposed one with the other.  -- The chapter that many readers would want to be the most complete and cutting-edge (that on care of clams in the aquarium, Chapter 5) is the least informational of the book.  The worst section in that chapter is probably the section on lighting.  This section includes absolutely no mention of lighting intensity in any usably objective terms (PAR or even lux), and wastes five paragraphs with a repetitive monologue of his subjective opinions on the 'looks' of various color temperature bulbs.  This chapter also includes a section on feeding, which spends ALL of its ten pages explaining how, how much, what and when to feed, only to conclude with the recommendation ""if you want to avoid all of this, just do what I've done for years (as have a gazillion other hobbyists) and only keep tridacnids in well-established, well-stocked aquariums with bright lights and don't worry about them.(p. 183)""  It should also be pointed out that the book devotes most of Chapter 2 to why Tridacnids need not be fed at all!  Lastly, there was no information in the chapter on care of clams that is not currently what passes for common knowledge in the hobby.  While this is fine, in the sense that a book can be usefully a compilation of common practices, I expected more.  In summary: a book that most interested hobbyists will find is worth owning, in spite of the fact that it falls short of a bar that has been set by recent books in the hobby, including Wilkerson's ""Clownfishes"", Borneman's ""Aquarium Corals"" and the three volumes of Delbeek and Sprung's ""The Reef Aquarium"".",3
finish reading this book in 2 days. this book covers pretty much everything from the caring to selection of tridacnid clams. i hv 5 clams in my reef tank. this book has really taught me a lot of things i hv overlooked such as feeding. i highly recommend this book.,3
"I purchased the Trilogy with hoping my two cats, age 3 and 5 would be interested.  The 3 yr old cat was fascinated for about 15 minutes but when the same pictures came on, she got bored.  The 5 year old watched for about a few minutes but then walked away. It is possible that because we have a wonderful courtyard full of greenery and trees and one of my neighbors has a bird feeder, that there is enough going on outside that they prefer real life versus a taped version.  I will more than likely pass this on to a friend who has cats that don't have as much wildlife to watch as mine do.",3
"My cats don't watch TV...  If they can't smell it, they don't care. Maybe yours do.  But, well, unless yours do already, don't bother with these TV time cat videos.",3
Really wish that I had just purchased volume one. It is the best.  based on what my cats preferred. It is hysterical watching your cat as they watch the video. worth every penny!!!!,3
My cats actually watched these DVDs. In the beginning they tried to get the birds by reaching behind the television but once they got used to the deal they settled down and just watched intently.  It was funny when a bird would fly out of the picture the cats would want to dart that way too.,3
"I bought the triliogy and have tested out all the DVDs.  It appears that volume 2 is the most well received of the three and the one I would recommend.  It's funny to watch my cat watch it bc she looks behind the TV trying to find the birds.  I turn this on sometimes when I'm leaving the house, by the time I get home, she doesn't seem to be paying attention anymore but figured she'd at least enjoy the sounds.",3
"If I had gotten just volume two, I would have given it five stars, but since I got the trilogy, I can only give it three stars.  I read all the reviews, and knew that vol. two was the best, hands down, but for few extra dollars I decided to get all three in a combo pack.  Since birds are a natural source of food for cats (feral) it was natural that they were instantly attracted to vol. two. Contrary to all the cartoons, cats are not fishermen, and thus, fish, either in a bowl or in the wild are not something they are naturally attracted to. Since gerbils and guinea pigs are not native where I live, they could have been little dogs as far as my cats could tell. Rodents are also a natural food, so volume one was much better than volume three. Also, the quality could have been better (for my eyes only) but my cats could care less about video quality... they just see birds..  LOL",3
"My two year old Egyptian mau kitten loves watchng birds, at first she loved watching the birds over and over, and now she knows that it is a dvd.  Terri",3
"My female kitty could care less about these videos-but she cares less about almost everything. My little male however digs these. He doesn't go ape over them, but he really does watch them for a bit and it makes me feel better to throw them on when I have to go out to work and leave him.",3
"Puppy Booster Herbal Supplement for Dogs is my puppy best friend, my puppy even as for it every morning. better price than in petco here",3
good for puppies who not have problems to keep not having problems. easy to give to active do. many useful vitamins.,3
"puppy booster is perfect for my puppy, I love it, works almost right away, great strength, easy to give to puppies. large size, almost no smell, herbal supplement",3
powerful protection for the dog immune system. i really love that product and my dog also loves it. great herbal supplement. does not leak,3
"Amazon is the place to shop and this seller is exceptional.  Mistakes happen, but it's the way the mistakes are handled that convince a buyer that a seller is one to trust and use repeatedly, as we shall this seller. We were looking for a booster for our dog and decided on  this one after reading positive reviews. We received the product promptly, but there was a tiny perfectly round hole in the bottom of the vial through which much of the gel had leaked.  We were very disappointed, as our pup really could have used an immune booster. The seller arranged immediately for a refund and sent a new bottle of the gel without charge.  What more can be said?  Trust this product and this seller.",3
"power mune by vet vitals is good for immune system, really works, good for fixing immune system, this one is chicken flavor, power mune will make a tiger out of your dog or cat. actually powerful.",3
"I'VE OWNED AND TRAINED DOGS FOR 20 YEARS AND HAVE USED MANY DIFFERENT NON ABUSIVE METHODS TO WORK WITH PROBLEM DOGS,  AND I BELIEVE CESARS APPROACH IS NOT ONLY THE MOST SIMPLE AND HUMANE BUT IT WORKS.  HE SHOWS HOW SIMPLE CORRECTIONS CAN BRING ABOUT INSTANT RESULTS WITHOUT HAVING TO BE AGGRESSIVE OR ABUSIVE TO THE ANIMAL.  I'M NOT SURE WHAT BOOK OR PROGRAM THE OTHER REVIEWER IS WATCHING, BECAUSE ANYONE WHO IS CONSISTENT WITH CESARS TECHNIQUES WILL GET THE DESIRED RESULTS.  I'VE WATCHED HIS PROGRAM SINCE THE BEGINNING AND HAVE ADDED HIS BOOK TO THE MANY OTHERS I REFER TO IN MY WORK.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND HIS BOOK TO ANYONE WHO WANTS TO HAVE A BETTER UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR DOG!!",3
"The poster who stated that Cesar's methods are archaic and use pain to correct the dogs obviously hasn't spent time watching the show.  Cesar never causes the dogs any pain or injury. In fact, several of the dogs on his show have bitten holes in his hands but he never, never reacts in a way that is painful to the dog. He maintains his calm assertive self.  Cesar's corrections consist of a noise ""shhhh"" and a brief tug on the leash. Cesar works with the type of collar the owner has on the dog. That may be buckle, choke, martingale, or pinch/prong. None of Cesar's corrections are physically damaging to the dog. Incidentally, the prong/pinch collar is not a cruel device when used correctly. It is meant as a TRAINING AID, to be used for no more than 2 weeks to help gain control of larger dogs that need help mastering leash etiquette. A person should ALWAYS consult a professional trainer for information on the proper use of pinch/prong collars. Shock collars should never be used unless they are set on a ""beep"" only setting and under the supervision of a professional.  Please, if you own a dog, watch this show! This DVD set is filled with valuable information about canines and our relationship with them. Cesar gives good information in a no nonsense way that anyone can follow. The first season was wonderful, and you can bet I'm going to tune in for season two! Our canines need an advocate like Cesar.  I'd give this two thumbs up!",3
"I Love Love Love Any & All of Cesar's Teachings! He's Soooo... Practical & Makes So Much Sense!! He Always Gives a Deep Understanding (explanation) of Why or What Causes a Dog (or animal) the behavior & then ""How to Correct"" that unwanted animal behavior. 10 Thumbs Up for Cesar Millian!!!!!",3
Loved it. I couldn't stop watching this series. Saw it in 2 sittings this weekend. I learned so much I didn't know about dogs.,3
I love lots of Cesar's tips but he needs to update his old school rather aggressive methods.,3
How can you miss with Cesar Milan? He's the best Dog Whisperer!!!,3
"He seems really full of himself and I'm not so sure the dogs are ""trained"". I just get the feeling that they are putting the best examples on the show and the failures hit the editing room floor.",3
"fun to watch , learned allot of useful information ,worth watching",3
gives me ideas on how and why dogs act like they do.,3
"I am such a huge Cesar fan, and this was worth every penny, he is a godsend",3
"Please see the other reviews we've written about ""Dog Whisperer."" The show is great, both educational and entertaining. And Amazon needs to develop a way to rate multiples of the same thing! Why write the same review for every year's episodes of ""Dog Whisperer""???",3
"I ordered this DVD Series ""used"". Normally, I do not buy ""used"" DVD's, CD's or Books unless the product is rated ""nearly new"" or in ""very good"" condition. The seller rated this product ""good"" so I was hesitant but ordered anyway because of the great price (under $8 for the entire first season). I was ecstatic when it arrived only a few short days after I ordered it and in my opinion was in ""nearly new"" condition. I appreciate the sellers honesty regarding the condition of the outer casing and would not hesitate to order from this seller again. I greatly appreciate the speed and integrity in which they demonstrated with this fantastic DVD series.",3
"Cesar shines a light on many issues modern dog owners have, and how to remedy them.  Its fascinating to watch him work.",3
"In my opinion, can't go wrong with Cesar Millan. Have admired him and his abilities from the very beginning. Would highly recommend anything from The Dog Whisperer!",3
I thoroughly enjoy watching Dog Whisperer episodes.  I think that Cesar Millan's philosophy regarding dogs can apply to every aspect of life... Don't reward bad behavior!!!,3
Getting a rescue dog which you never know what past comes with the dog.. So I wanted to see how Cesar handled various situations... He is so good understanding the minds and behaviors of dogs... Each episode is different in its own way... Love the dvd..,3
"I have acquired an American Eskimo about 3 years ago and have been searching, buying and trying a lot of books, training courses and dog obedient classes since.  I ran across the TV show recently when I switched TV to satellite.  I only wish I have found out about this earlier.  A lot of the reviewers have covered almost every aspects, I just want to include a few points from my views from the shows.  The whole idea of Cesar's method is really simple, be the pack leader and the dog will follow, that will indirectly solve most of the unwanted behavior.  Although the execution is more complicated plus he has a pack of dogs to help him(this is a significant tool that most of us or other dog trainer lack of).  I have owned Season 1, 2 & 3 in DVD, plus all the episodes I have taped from Season 4 to 7.  I cannot find any evidence of inhuman behavior or forces as described by some viewers.  Pinning the dog down is the most ""violent"" I have seen but even that, Cesar did not use force or tool, he was only making the dog in a laying down position.  In face, Cesar has been bitten quite a few times!!  And the touches he uses are for correction, if that's really hurting dogs, I am sure the dogs would have attacked Cesar already.  All dogs seems to responded to Cesar all the time and his touches are so effective, almost like miracles.  Let's not forget he is gifted with some ability such as feeling the dog's energy.  He always touch before the dog escalate.  Until we practice this, we'll never have as effective touch as he is, but the shows are definitely fun to watch, just don't expect the same result.  The last point I want to make is about the comment of his technique.  Some viewer regard it as old school.  It is probably true but then it will always works as long as following the leader is still in the DNA.  This is still true today for pack animal such as lions or elephants.  In fact, all those so called new technique does not work well for abused dogs.  I believe Cesar's method covers a much more variety of situation.",3
The first season of Cesar is a great introduction to his methods and does not assume that you know anything about him or his methods. From time to time I go back to this first season to refresh myself on some of the basics of his method and philosophy. I enjoy these episodes every time.,3
"Cesar is truly a genuis of what he does.  He has the ability to get the most misbehaved dogs and rehab them to get them back to being great companions.  The only problem with the series that I have is the story is almost always the same.  Aggressive dog, Ceasar comes and teaches the owners to be better pack leaders, thus dog becomes less aggressive.  I would love to see more episodes focused on other problems besides aggressive dogs.",3
"I have four dogs--different breeds, different personalities, different temperaments.  All have come from homes where the original ""owners"" tired of them for one reason or another.  This motley crew did not immediately become a happy pack.  I had no idea how to deal with the problem.  Then I watched Cesar Millan's Dog Whisperer--over and over.  I immediately began to use Cesar's approach: seeing myself as the pack leader, exercising the dogs more (and together!), behaving more like the dogs' mothers would have behaved (yes, I applied a bit of pressure to the neck with my fingertips--the Mom ""bite"").  Now I have a happy, peaceful pack of contented, well-exercised, balanced dogs.  And I am a happy, peaceful pack leader.  Now my dogs are not a source of frustration and guilt, but a source of joy, love, and connectedness.  Cesar is a wonder!",3
"I've recently got hooked on Ceasar's dog whisperer show and have been trying to rehabilitate my 8 year old dog.  She's improved amazingly on her walks but there is still a lot I need to train her on. Watching what he does dog after dog, makes me want to stop everything a get to work.  I think he's amazing at what he does, and watching the video you are reminded of that over and over again.  The only negative thing I have to say about the disc set is that unlike when the show airs on the national geographic channel, it doesn't give you an update on how the dog is doing after the session.  Otherwise, it's highly recommended!",3
I was impressed how he handled the dogs. What do you do with dogs digging in the garden when you don't see them doing it ?,3
"I read the book, and after watching the program, I have a much better understanding of the techniques Cesar uses to bring dogs under control. It gets a bit repetitive but the repetition does bring home the lessons. My dogs and I are better for it; much more cooperation between us. The extras were a waste of time, quite frankly, and could be left out. All in all,worth the time.",3
Interesting and tasty (at least according to our dogs' response) recipes that are clearly written and easy to follow.  If you want to make your own food and treats this book is a must.,3
"I was curious about making home cooked food to supplement our new puppy's diet. Not exclusively, mind you, but I definitely wanted to incude some fresh food along with her (high quality) kibble.  This book has plenty of great recipes for every meal, from breakfast to dinner, desserts, special occasions, and even training snacks. There are also recipes for homemade kibble and Kong toy stuffing. Plus there is some information on what not to feed a dog (like onions and grapes). I'll definitely be preparing some of the recipes from this.",3
"Lots of good recipes for your furry babies.  Easy to make, and lots of them to choose from in the book.",3
A lot of options to make. But nothing for Diabetic Dogs or Senior dogs.,3
"like this it has recipes for my budget that I can make and 3 types of treats I've made so far my dog loves, I'm now gathering things to start making his meals and freezing them, hope he likes them as much as his treats, way cheaper than buying treats for him...",3
My dogs love the recipes! I have 8 and have tried many of the recipes. So much better for your critters than ready made store bought brands.,3
like the book a lot. thank you for your fast service.,3
Love the cookbook can't wait to start cooking for my dogs!!!!,3
"nutri calm works great, my puppy does love it and so I love to use it to give to my puppy. puppy actually becomes calmer within few hours after it. almost no smell",3
I am disappointed in the quality of these.  They have significantly deteriorated in just a few uses.  I am going to stick with using foil.,3
I have now purchased all 4 of these bands. I already have a full home gym and use it nearly daily but these bands have provided an awesome addition allowing me to work muscles I don't think I've ever worked. They're guide could be more extensive because I've found many new/interesting ways to use them and work even more muscles.,3
"Got it for my brother's dog, since she was having a lot of stiffness in her hindquarters. It has helped.",3
"Replacement blades are so expensive that my husband decided it'd make more sense to just buy a new razor; however, he discovered that wasn't the case. He liked his existing Norelco so much better that he returned the new razor and bought the replacement heads for his old. He said he's glad he did, and the blades are doing a great job!",3
"Bought this set about two months ago and never got a chance to use them, needed a white elephant gift last minute so this is it.  It was a hot item for sure, my receptionist was the final winner and she said she's amazed at how soft the bristles are.  A great little set that's affordable and makes good gifts.",3
Have been using this hair spray for years.  The 5 pc set was a great buy,3
Strong magnets once you remove the plastic film. Using them on a steel peg board they work great.,3
Got two for my backyard to hang on the fence.  They look great there!!  THanks!!,3
"Love this brush. I have an older brush that is not retractable and have never been able to clean it thoroughly. I have six dogs and they all like It, my one dog Frenchie loves it. She has always like me scratching her back, I think this is why she like it so much.",3
"Just tried it out on my Yorkie and my terrier chihuahua and this brush is amazing! My dogs loved how it felt and it left them feeling nice and smooth! The clean up was the best part, it didn't leave the hair clumped up in the brush like my old brush! I'm going to tell all my friends about this brush!",3
"Great product! This came auickly as alwsys, packed great as always. The bands come in a small black bag that is a huge advantage because all of my gym gear always gets list and just laying around everywhere. The color is vaibrant and size is great for these bands. Over all great gor your workout!",3
"I bought it for my daughter who is a fitness instructor. (She used other brands before and was unhappy). Now she's so satisfied with those and says they are the best. Easy to work with, comfortable and friendly.",3
The silver name tag is a little bit crooked but I still think this bag is adorable!!!!,3
"This product is fantastic. I use it for steaks also, to make sure they are cooked just right. I have had this product for several years and the battery is still good. I wanted to get one for my son, but I can't find it anywhere online. Amazon doesn't have it and doesn't know when they will again. Even the AcuRite website doesn't have it. I guess it was discontinued. How can you discontinue such a great item?",3
"Used these for a Star Wars theme cupcake order, they worked just fine for baking and the kids loved the liners and cute BB8 toppers!",3
Best Stuff to make your own fish feed - Really happy with this and the fish love it,3
worked great and even better then ones that came with Grill,3
"Great bands!  I bought two red ones for some resistance training on the barbell, these are a little smaller but with the right use you can get what you need. I also bought a green band and I think this one is a little narrower than the standard green bands you see in the gym.  I wanted this to help my wife do pull-ups, and this does the trick!  She's pretty excited she can work her way up to unassisted pull-ups!",3
"This is the best and safest dog treat on the market. My dogs actually refuse to eat any other treat. There has never been a recall (to my knowledge), on these treats. Highly recommend!",3
dog's love it my baby's are doing so great on this food also feed the dry they have not had any problem's with hot spot's since feeding this brand thank u so much for this wonderful food will never switch again,3
"Love it. Soft, light, and breezy. A little difficult to place over comforter as there are no ties but once placed the comforter stays put. It's perfect. I recommend.  - not sure if these covers come without ties or if it was just the one I got, either way it worked out.",3
"I like laundry bags, these are nice quality it appears.  The zipper has a ""lock"" so it won't open in your washer.  It's nice to have more so you can put less in each back and use a couple.  That way your clothes get cleaner in my opinion.  The thing I don't like so much is that the biggest size is gigantic and you get 4 (of each size).  I don't really need 4 gigantic bags, the medium and small size are perfect although smaller is more needed than medium.  Another thing is that the mesh is really fine, that is nice for bras with hooks or other things with small buttons but it feels very stiff and inflexible which is also a draw back for getting your stuff clean.  Maybe they get softer with use.",3
"Colors are virtually exact as in the photo. We bought this to lay over our dogs' bed to cut down on having to wash the actual bed cover. While I am happy with the item it is not as heavy as what I expected. We have purchased similar throws from Walmart that are heavier and more durable. My only concern is how long this one will last. If you want it just for 'pretty', or a light weight cover, it is a lovely throw.  But if you are expecting something durable, you might want to keep looking.",3
"I have a young maltipoo who loves toys. This is the first dog I've ever had who has liked toys this much. A little under a year ago we got him the Mr. Moose (that's what we call it) from the above collection. He loved it so much he took it to his crate at night. I even bought him a second one a few months later in case the first Mr. Moose met with foul play.  Well, when I saw this collection of three Kong toys (including yet a third Mr. Moose) I went for it. We intended to give him one toy at a time, but he got into the doggy box and pulled out all three and he was in doggy heaven.  I don't know whether it's the size, the shapes, the smells, or what it is about these Kong toys, but they are just so terrific. He wrestles with them and chews on them and  we play catch with them as well,  and they really take a beating and keep on ticking. He loves them all (though Mr. Moose is probably still the favorite with the alligator a close second.)  I cannot recommend them enough. Our Vinnie is a small dog but he chews and abuses these toys all day and like I said, he's had the Kong Moose for well over 8 months and hasn't torn through it yet. Perhaps for a bigger dog that might be a problem, but these Kong toys are so sturdy they're the only ones I really feel comfortable leaving him with in his crate at night.  Highly recommended. OBVIOUSLY.",3
"If you have 40+ year old Paul Revere from Oneida, you'll notice a difference. Doesn't perfectly match the existing pieces (more noticeable on flatware, especially when you stack it), but you have to be looking to tell.",3
"Perfect! Exactly what I needed, and I like being able to alternate colors. It helps with sorting somehow",3
"I LOVED these sheets when they first came. They are SO soft and wonderful. Unfortunately within a few days there was a small hole in them :( I had only washed them once before putting them on. Not sure if I just got a bad one, but other than the small tear, I love them.",3
I love correlle! With kids doing the dishes I got tired of stoneware chipping but with correlle plates there is no worry! This design is perfect for our woodland house. I'll definitely be collecting more pieces.,3
Fun calendar.  Bought this for my Grandmother to quiz us every day. So far she has enjoyed it and I would recommend to others.,3
"Good price, but is made of shiny slippery rubber. I prefer the ones that aren't slippery.",3
"This calendar is beautiful! The prints are fun and have fantastic color, the grid is also very clean with lots of space for notes. Only complaint is the pages are not glossy so sharpies will bleed through (which is my pen of choice for calendars).",3
"Adorable!  A little bit heavy but not too bad.  The weight gives it a nicer feel.  Nice details, nicely painted.  Very nice handiwork.  I think the little bone on the bottom is to add a name, but we aren't going to do that.  It's cute just a blank bone (or can remove it if it bugs us).",3
"Delivered as advertised.  Works great!  The price was a little steep, but when you're buying a discontinued item, that's the reality.",3
It is solid metal with exception of nozzle and rubber grip. Grip feels like high grade rubber but still the kind of rubber that will degrade if exposed to chemicals or oils. My hose is broken but it pressure tested ok. I will update this review if it later turns out to be crap but so far I would say its a good unit over all.,3
"These spatulas are a little smaller than I expected, but they are silicone and do the trick.",3
"Now my 3/8"" sockets are nutdrivers.  The 3/8"" female end makes this into a 10"" extension to really tighten these bolts.  The handle is not as comfortable as my other 3/8"" spinner, but being able to attach my ratchet more than makes up for it.  It's a very solid tool.",3
"This review is for Premium Stainless Steel 5 Piece Kitchen Essentials Knife Set with Stainless Steel Knife Holder Stand.  This set is really sharp with the metallic looking butcher block.  Definitely a change from the standard wooden ones. As for the knives themselves, they are quite sharp and have a quality feel to them. I am hoping they will hold up like my ceramic ones do. They really do look good sitting on my countertop.  I have stainless steel appliances and black and brown granite -- so this really fits right in.",3
"Background: I have the purple band. I am a runner, bicyclist, and like to exercise in general. With this band, I hope to get back into the same shape as college a few years ago using body weight and these bands to work my core. My favorite twisting core exercise are russian twists where the band is attached to a wall or pole, you are facing to the side, and bring the other end of the band across your body with straight arms, feet planted which works your core, shoulders, and arms. Holy moley, this band is whooping my butt!  Pros: 1) Strength: The strength of this band is exceptional. With the exercises that I do, it gives me plenty of resistance that does not change each time I use it. I can't wait until I get strong enough again where I can get more dynamic with this band. 2) Comfort: It is smooth and ""soft"" making it nice to hold.  Cons: 1) Width: the width makes it a little awkward to hold. Its not terrible or uncomfortable, but I notice it. I may become numb to it eventually. I would have made the band less wide but a little thicker.  Overall, this band will do the job over and over. It seems robust and certainly has the right amount of resistance for a full variety of exercises. I used to love working out with these type of bands while running track and am happy to be able to get some of these to get back into those exercises.  Note: I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I already am a fan of using resistance bands for workouts and had to jump on the opportunity. I hope the review helped!",3
"Had a plastic hose reel that was problematic from day one and it finally fell apart. Decided to go simpler, with a hose holder that I can simply wind the hose into. Not as big as I thought, but it holds over 100' of Craftsman rubber hose without a problem. Not sure if the post in the center made any difference when it comes to winding up the hose, but it doesn't get in the way, so it is fine in my book. Nice finish  with thick lacquer which I am hoping will keep it from corroding or rusting out anytime soon.",3
This is the perfect size to carry coffee.  the double vacuum will keep coffee hot or cold drinks cold for a long time.  It has a very sleek look and it will fit nicely in back pack pockets.  the quick release cover allows for easy access with one hand.  I received a discount to review this product.,3
A very well balanced spatula that is strong as well as flexible.,3
"I have used it with pasta. Did not work the greatest, had to add water twice. But it works for old fashioned rolled oats. I use the orange one. 1/2 cup oats, dash of sea salt, and one cup boiling water. Let set about 7 min with lid secure.  What I like is that I can let this sit and get other things done. No babysitting a pan. Have not tried veggies yet.",3
"Great vibrant purple! Looks great with my mixed media projects. Tip: if you push the spray 1/2 way, you get a droplet effect (or splatter effect), if you press it all the way you get a nice fine mist.",3
"I'm obsessed with these suddenly. Use them as a dinner mat, use as a cutting board, use as a hot tray... these things are so handy. I got 2 of them in the bright green. I was thinking they'd be like any other silicone mat but these are even better!  Once you place them on your counter you have to peel them if you want them off. Which is a good thing, because they won't slip around. And they do t leave any residue behind as they are simply silicone. I would definitely recommend these! They are so handy to have around. Plus they were really low cost and fast shipping! A+ all around",3
What can I say?  This was a replacement for a bowl cover that had chipped badly.  It fit my work bowl and I'm happy it was available.,3
I am satisfied with my purchase and am glad that I went through here.  Thank you!,3
"This set is so cute! I love to get all dressed up for my husband every once in a while, and surprise him with a really nice meal. This apron is perfect for covering up and protecting my outfit and still looking cute at the same time. When I first ordered this, I mistakenly thought it was a set of 4 aprons. Had I read the description in detail, I would've seen that it's actually a set of 1 apron, 1 napkin, 1 kitchen towel, and 1 hot pad, all matching. They are made out of sturdy cotton, so they are all very easily machine washable. I would definitely recommend this set to all home cooks. It's cute, practical, and unisex too. I received this item at a discount in exchange for my honest and unbiased review. I hope this was helpful to you!",3
"These bags are awesome and help me when I travel. I travel a lot for work and I'm always looking for ways to pack better and more efficiently. These are really lightweight and don't add any weight to the luggage. They're drawstring and stay closed. There are ; different sizes in a set and I use them for different things - clean clothes, dirty clothes, socks, etc.  They're not too big. They're a lot smaller than a laundry bag. I included a picture of the largest for reference.  They're also really cute. I love having fun travel accessories.  I received this product at a discount for my honest review.",3
"These made a great gift for my friends. I'll have to ask them if they keep the wine cool, but either way they were a hit.",3
These work great with seed/pantry moths.  I always keep one going next to the love bird cage.,3
"I had a party and wanted it to be as green as possible. This table cover helped with that. I didn't feel nearly as guilty as if I'd used a plastic one, although it did come sealed in plastic. Nice color, too.",3
"A  very nicely made, small-size gnome....almost too nice to use in the little contest we have  going with our neighbors where we surprise each other from time to time with a well-hidden garden decoration. This guy is a cut above most garden gnomes...",3
Friends:  We don't often have Canaps at our Horse ranch in the remote Sangre de Cristo mountain range of Colorado but we do eat big meals so I mostly used these for individual butter dishes.  The match a large collection of flat wear by the same company.....  I bought four sets of everything from www.amazon.com on a single morning of on-line shopping.  This stuff can go into the dishwasher.  It looks so Good I keep the Kitchen center island which is nine foot by five foot set all the time as if we were having guests.  Google my name to Learn more......  Arthur von Boennighausen,3
"Friends:  I use this pitcher for flowers in water...... It matches a bunch of plates, cups and other flat wear made by the same company.  This is a large pitcher with a wide base.  Someone once told me that flowers are God's thoughts in physical form......  Google my name to Learn more......  Arthur von Boennighausen",3
As described and got if quickly.  Well made and looks great at my front entrance.  A like pricy but could not find anything like this in my area.,3
Beautiful item and you can actually use it  Nice size canisters. Would buy from seller again,3
"Love Pimpernel.  My first set was received as a gift in 1983.  Since then  I have 5 different large placemat sets and mix and match the patterns. My guests appreciate the fact that they don't worry about spilling sauce or gravy on their placemat because they wipe clean.  BEAUTIFUL!  I love the Jason pattersons also, but their placemats are a little too large for my table.",3
"These are just what I wanted last Christmas, but I could not find them.  So when I saw them on Amazon I bought ahead for next xMas.  They are very pretty, and look to be quite well made.  If I have any problems using them I will update.",3
Like the idea of personalizing Nora Fleming platters for different occasions.  This ducky is adorable and looks great on the dish.,3
Perfect for cleaning up after the dogs. I may have to buy another one for the garden. Very solid better than I expected.,3
"It is affordable, beautiful and there is room to write my appointments for each day of the month.  Also, it is light so I can carry it in my purse all the time.",3
"I purchased this because my favorite architectural style is ""storybook"" and I was looking for something along that vein.  This fits the bill perfectly and looks very cute on my deck.",3
We needed a night light next to the bathroom and this one fit the bill. It gives off just enough to see but not wake you up.,3
"I LOVE this colander. The old one I had lasted for about 20 years, so I can't complain. But it was stained and one handle had broken off. It was time for a new one by a long shot. lol I looked specifically for one that was purple - my favorite color - and was delighted to find this one. The holes are cheerful smiley faces, the size is perfect, the handles are easy to grip, it is well balanced, and of course the color is beautiful.",3
"I just bought this set on sale for 10 bucks and have to say they are definitely worth it. They are heavy duty, not delicate. You do not have to be afraid to use them. The short stem and the foot are thick as well, so no worries there either.  There is very slight seam, which is to be expected when buying ""cheap"""" crystal. The way it is positioned, along with the pattern on the glass, makes it barely noticeable. You will only see it if you really search for it. I am picky and I usually never buy any type of crystal or glass that has a seam - this was the first time and it was only because it isn't noticeable and the price was too good to pass up.  They look great and the design can blend in with practically any dcor theme.",3
"Different from the ""Fat Max"" tape measure, these MaxSteel tapes are durable and stand up to heavy use. It's a shame they are discontinued. Bought one just to have a backup in case they become impossible to find anymore.",3
"After watching a series of YouTube videos by Tim Holtz I decided to try some of his products. The price was right at Amazon. I'm not very experienced with using these yet, but so far so good!",3
i never thought i would be using curlers again!  bought those velcro ones and pulled out several strands of hair with each roller.  searched and searched - so surprised when i found them.  only looked on amazon cause i was getting so many other hard to find items.  they are made just as good as they use to be 45 yrs. ago.,3
"This coffee cup is really nice and great with the bright colors!!!  If you love the wizard of oz or shoes, you will love this cup!  Best part about it is it's microwave and dishwasher safe!",3
"Delivery from Scrapbooking Alley was very fast. Their prices compared to a number of retailers is also very good and shipping is free with at least $50 in purchases or a very reasonable $5.95 up to $50.  A big note for those who purchased the 4oz Color Wash spray in the last year: Ranger discontinued several colors like Pesto, Mushroom, Terra Cotta etc. and also discontinued the 4oz size. Now there is only a 2oz size but it costs the same as the 4oz size so that works out to a 100% price increase. Thanks a lot Ranger.  The 2oz size does however spray a finer mist than the 4oz size. The 4oz sprayed lots of large drops regardless of the angle it was used at but was easy to transfer to a bottle with a finer spray.  All the color wash sprays work incredibly well on a number of materials. I've used it mainly on paper, card-stock and grass-cloth and the color on those has become permanent when dry. After spraying with the color wash sprays you can spray a fine mist of water to blend the colors further. The colors are really rich but they are less intense than the matching alcohol inks. When purchasing note that even the 2oz goes really far as you use relatively small amounts for great effect.  A quick tip is to use a cardboard box layered with paper or card-stock when spraying. This prevents the spray from getting on other objects or furniture and also gives a two for one as you get some interesting looking paper in addition to the item you are spraying. Another tip is that the large drops normally emerge within the first three sprays so if you are trying to avoid a splotchy look use the spray on paper first before spraying your object.  Note: Purple Twilight looks awesome blended with Lettuce or Sunset Orange or Butterscotch or Cranberry or Red Pepper.",3
"It's better than most, but I feel that Shun's quality went down over the years. This knife doesn't feel as sturdy as my old Shun for some reason. I've had this knife for over a year now. It became my ""beater"". It holds an edge, but dulls out quicker than my other knives. It also takes a lot of work to get it razor sharp.",3
"Like the above reviewer, I too believe this is the best ever, conceived, designed, and produced, large/covered bowl on the market!!! I am currently trying in vain to find another one. It is hard to find a lot of Bodum in the US. There is an Adobe pdf online,of all their products, & if you are a kitchen princess like me, you would drool perusing it. Although they  do have this bowl listed, it doesn't say how to purchase one. I had mine for about 8 yrs. It was perfect for when you have to make tons of say potato salad, or maybe 2 pounds of macaroni salad & want to take it to a gathering & have it look absolutely beautiful. The cover fit well. It was a beautiful object.......until I made the mistake of sending it with my husband to a hunting weekend. Broken on the trip home! If anyone knows where to find one.....please email me!",3
I bought this for my husband to BBQ. This is our 1st silicone brush. We don't realize it can hold that much BBQ sauce. We were considering OXO brush but this one is on sale. We have been happy with Mario Batali's product so we decide to give it a try. ( We have Mario Batali pizza cutter and dough cutter )I think this is a good purchase and will recommend to anyone. It holds up sauce good and easy to clean.,3
"Excellent product, very sharp as advised, the packaging was little on the cheap side.  Word of advise, be very careful using the Shun knives, they are not very forgiven and will treat your fingers no differently than the meat your are cutting!  Highly recommended.",3
"If you make dessert souffles (chocolate or jam-filled) these small heart shaped ramekins are just the thing to dress up your table. THey also hold cheese, dips or other small side dishes. The colors are very modern and interesting; if you know someone who has used deep brown and kiwi or aqua in their decor, this would make quite a housewarming gift. Or Valentine's day present.",3
"I like having something like this on hand when my dogs are slightly under the weather, because if I ran to the vets for every little health problem, I wouldn't be able to afford having my two lovable dogs I love so much.",3
the book finally arrived and was so worth the wait!!!  It is full of stories and first hand accounts that are excellent and helpful,3
Working very well on my health helper. No more calling and then getting myself worked up,3
Something new I'm  trying with my puppy seems to be working. Training is easy with the explanation and cards that came along with book.  Thank you.,3
"This is an excellent, concise book, outlining the best and most efficacious way to train a dog - or any animal, for that matter.  We give a copy to almost everyone who adopts one of our dogs, and this is the method we use to train them, prior to adoption.  Dogs love clicker training, and they are able to learn quickly and happily, without any fear of making mistakes.",3
"Bought for a friend, Karen is spot on the mark when it comes to clicker training. Having ""written the book"" so to speak, all of her teachings are clear and to the point. She has saved the lives of many animals. I credit her methods to allowing me to reach my way smart and fast JRT! We never would have made it without the 'clicker'! (note: works on people too.)",3
"Hope this works. Clicker is so loud, my Pug jumps. May be more a deterrent than a training incentive.",3
"Don't understand the concept.  Wait for your dog to stumble along and do something right then giv e them a click and a treat.  I'm more of a traditional ""negative"" reinforcement kind of guy.  Dog does something wrong and he gets a squirt of water or a blast of the ultrasonic dog trainer along with a negative tone from me. worked on all my dogs for 40 years",3
"If you purchase this book, when you get it and peruse the contents you won't imagine that the ideas within it could help in training your pet dog. That is what is so unique about the book. I have used the ideas within it's pages and trust me they work without having to beat on your pet.",3
"Unless you plan on becoming a full-fledged trainer encountering every kind of dog and advanced tricks, this may not be for you.  It is a fairly simple, low-budget publishing offering.  The author could have used an editor for formatting and compartmentalizing the sections.  I honestly can't remember anything that stood out.  I learned the basics of clicker training by summarizing the greater text, which is what I asked out of the book.  There just isn't anything special about it.",3
"I normally don't go for stuff like this. I gave it a try. I think obediance classes are optimum to a great relationship with your pet...even if you don't ahve the money to dish out, go to friends who have dogs.",3
"Went to Clicker Training Classes in my area. Wanted a refresher course for myself. Happy with this purchase, and the lessons provided.",3
"Got the clickers yesterday and my dogs already respond to them. Will read the book for more info. This and the silent whistle, which works GREAT, keeps us from yelling at them.",3
We give this book to our clients for them to get a basic understanding of clicker training so when they come to our training class they are ahead of the game.  We have gotten good feedback from them.  I add homework that I've made up straight from the book to make sure they have read it.,3
This book is good for any dog owner. Even if you don't actually do the training the dog psychcology information is invaluable.,3
READ REVIEW ON I-CLICKER 5 PACK!  I BOUGHT INTO THE HOLE DEAL AND IT IS NOT EFFECTIVE FOR ME!  SORRY,3
Great book easy to follow I can't wait to read the next one. I have learned so much about clicker training and my dog has too.,3
"I purchased this book and I have had amazing results from my Morkie puppy!  Due to the book and clickers, she has learned to sit, shake hands, lay down, stand on her hind legs plus I leash trained her in less than a month!  She is currently 13 weeks old very young to know so much.  I credit the achievements made by the book!  I have read it twice!  Very understandable!",3
"Found this book to be well-written, easy to understand, and even though I was skeptical before reading, it really does make sense. The training is based on operant conditioning (positive reinforcement) which has been scientifically proven to work. My dogs really do get it which makes behavioral training much easier than with traditional (negative) effects. I like Karen Pryor's approach so much I purchased another of her books, ""Don't Shoot the Dog! The New Art of Teaching and Training"" which goes in-depth as to how and why this style of training works. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND both titles.",3
"It's thorough, but I use the clicker in a much different way.  Throughout the book, the idea that's presented is to get the dog's attention and then reinforce what he does right with a reward.  But for my dog, it works best to use the clicker to warn of bad behavior.  Maybe my dog didn't read the book....",3
"Whoever invented clicker training is a genius. This not only avoids over-treating (feeding) your dog during training and thus a healthy alternative to snacks.  After initial training, your dog will quickly associate ""clicks"" with your affirmation - but your response must be immediate.",3
"This is a good, quick intro to clicker training if you know nothing about it.  I think I didn't learn anything new from this book that I didn't already know from about a half hour's worth of internet surfing on clicker training - but that isn't the fault of the book given that Karen Pryor seems to be one of the eminent authorities on the subject and a lot of the info on the internet can probably be traced to her writings like this book.  I have to say though that almost half of it consisted of advocacy for clicker training, which seems unnecessary (I'm already reading the book so why devote two whole chapters and much of the others convincing me to go with clicker training?) and made the book even less useful.  I expected a procedural how-to, not a persuasive essay.  Overall, though, I thought it was solid for a ""Getting Started"" type book.",3
I train basic obedience and generally do NOT use clicker training unless asked. When they do I give them this book. A good basic book on clicker training if that is the method you prefer.,3
"good BASIC training for your dog. a step one book, not much after that, as the title says,""Getting Started""",3
This is the best starter clicker training book I have found.  Of course Karen Pryor is the premier trainer when it comes to clicker training and all training.  My service dog trainer recommended it and I love it.,3
"Clicker training will supercharge the training of your dog (and other animals) and strengthen the communication between you.  This is not the end-all, be-all book about clicker training (and doesn't purport to be) but it will allow you to get real results and give you useful skills to build on.",3
"I'm new to clicker training but with the help of Karen's book, my dog seems to be responding to it. In fact today she got off her run and if it weren't for the clicker training, I would have had difficulty getting her back. I am looking forward to working my dog more with it.",3
"This is truly the dumbest way to train a dog!!! I'm sorry. I was lost and confused and my own experience and someone who trains dogs ""professionally"" confirmed my suspicion.  See if any of these make any sense to you:  FACT: Doesn't it make more sense to rely on your voice from the get-go to mark a command or a behavior instead of the sound of click-click? But that's clicker training for you. So, unless you are mute or have three hands (one to hold the clicker, one to hold the treats, and another to hold the leash), there is no need for a clicking device.  FACT: In order to walk or train your dog, you just HAVE TO rely either on a leash, a collar, or a harness. Again, those tools are mandatory! Can you make the same kind of argument about a cheesy little box that makes a clicking sound? No, you cannot!  FACT: It is nearly impossible to stop a determined dog from attacking people, other dogs, kids, or the cats with a bunch of treats in one hand and a clicking device in the other. But with a leash and a proper collar, yes, you certainly could. I see people scream at their dogs and they are still ignored. The stupid clicker doesn't even stand a chance!  FACT: This method is more commonly used among dolphin and chicken trainers. The reason is simple: Try putting a leash on a dolphin or a cock and see what happens. They claim, since we cannot put dolphins on a leash, we'll get our clicker and use a bucket of fish in order to get their attention. But it's one thing to talk theory, and a totally different ballgame when we talk about REALITY! The reality is, don't you think if we could make dolphins and even elephants listen to us with a leash, that we would have by now?  You see, dolphins don't jump up on people, don't drag you down the street, don't lunge at dogs, and certainly don't terrorize your guests--but dogs DO!....  ... How can I add any emotions with the noise of a clicker? Don't you agree that there will be times when we need to sound firm, loud, praiseful, or just calm with our dogs? Need more convincing? Google: clicker training exposed!",3
"My dogs LOVE these collards. I didn't realize they came from Fab. but it doesn't really matter to me either. I have two red heelers who would wear anything I put on them, but these rasta collars really pop with their coats! The fabric is thick and durable and in the month or so that the dogs have been wearing them they haven't faded or stretched. The ring is securely sewn in, so I don't worry about the tags coming off of them anytime soon. We even walk one of our dogs with the leash attached directly to the collar. She's a submissive girl, but I've never seen her try to fight this collar off during our walk. (She's gotten out of some other ones before.) I like it a lot, hopefully they make a Colorado branded one soon!",3
This collar is beautiful!  Fits my English setter perfectly.  I love that it has a thick band.  Bright colors.  Love it!,3
"My dog loves it, lol.  He gets a lot of compliments on it.",3
"This collar looks awesome on our rottie. The colors really pop, and it totally reflects his calm and loving nature. The collar doesnt seem very durable, but thankfully the dude's blind so he hardly pulls when on a leash and on walks we use a harness.  Rasta Rott's for the win!",3
"I got this for my son's German Shepherd puppy, and now he's two years old and he still wears it because it's adjustable. Very pretty,  really good quality!",3
Love this collar and matching leash.  My dog is a chocolate brown labradoodle so the colors really stand out. It's a good quality collar for everyday use.  I will buy a back up for when this one gets too raggedy.,3
"We are very happy with this free standing wood gate.  It is good looking, keeps out Puggy boys out of trouble and is quite sturdy.  I am glad we got it!",3
"Keeps my big dogs out of the living room, which is what I needed it for.  I just wish I could figure out a better way to anchor it.  I'm using a bungee cord and the back of a bench.",3
"Perfect,  just what I wanted for dogs to put on front porch so they can't go down stairs and still don't have to fasten gate to stay up.",3
"Works for what it's intended. Definitely NOT as sturdy as expected, and it chips fairly easily. Priced too high for what the product is.",3
"This product exceeded our expectations. It's even rather handsome, is fairly sturdy as long as some angles are preserved, is heavier than anticipated, and, of course, allows for any number of configurations to fit odd openings. A very good value for the money.",3
After using the gate for a short time the slates came out. I have tried to glue them back in but very hard to do. I am so disappointed. It is not working for me. I spent too much money for this gate.,3
"This is a good looking gate that works very well in spaces where a standard size wouldn't work.  The only caveat is that our dog pretty quickly figured out how to push the end side out of the way to get past, but we just put a hook and eye at both ends and it is perfect.",3
"While the red color is very bright and visible, there is one major flaw with this product. The material with the buckle is very soft, and will slide out and the collar will just fall off. It wouldn't be a problem if they the material wasn't so smooth or if it had been made differently. DO NOT attach a leash to this collar. Even when my dog scratched his neck, it fell off.  My solution was, I cut off the housing for the LED, and stitched it into another 1"" collar that had was actually sewn secure.",3
"This collar looks really cool, It's not an overwhelmingly bright but you can definitely see it across the yard on a dark night. I particularly like blue color. And it has three options, a slow blink, a little faster blink and steadily on. I like the constant on mode personally. The clip makes it really easy to put on and take off and the leash hook up ring is heavy duty and high quality. Plus it is large enough to hook up easily.  I did receive this product at a discounted price in exchange for my honest and unbiased review which I have given here. I was in no way influenced by the manufacturer or seller. All opinions and statements are mine and mine alone.",3
I'm a dog groomer and I see a lot of collars and I will say this one is very well made and the lock is very easy to attach even for elderly folks who has a hard time locking collars. I received this at a discount for my 100% honest review.,3
I can find my lab in the yard at night. Very lightweight and he can wear it with his regular collar.,3
"I am constantly at the MX track at night, and this collar is amazing. The LED collar clips are great, but this is much more highly visible.",3
"I like this collar a lot, as I end up walking my dog after dark quite often. The collar looks pretty sweet and improves our visibility a lot. My dog gets really annoyed if I put the collar on either of the flashing light settings and will pretty much give me the stink eye until I fix it. I also feel that the collar is very soft and not particularly sturdy. It feels like it could come apart and ravel easily. I don't attach a leash to the collar, as I always walk on a harness, but I could see attaching a leash to be a problem with the collar breaking. I am satisfied with the product, I just caution others to know the limitations of the collar.",3
The product came quickly. The bright blue made my dog more excited to chase it than his other ball (dogs can see yellow and blue). However it isn't really durable. When I took it out of the package it seemed harder than a regular tennis ball. The ball hardly survived 1 game of fetch. It completely crumpled. My dog is a pit and has a strong jaw but prior to this we had a regular cheap tennis ball and it lasted a year. I'll give the remaining two balls to someone with smaller dogs.,3
I bought these balls thinking they were made in England; but they are made in China. It says so on the package. They are also really hard. I would recommend regular tennis balls or Kong balls over these.,3

Save $959.66 on a 4.4 oz tube which costs $9.34?  I would want this bargain even if I did not have a cat!,3
"I agree with other reviewer about this product -- it's very cat-specific in terms of which ones like it or not. It works. A cat either likes it from the start or doesn't, and that preference persist.  The ones that like it, LOVE it -- and I can't accidentally leave it on the counter since it will end up with puncture marks from them trying to bite into it.  The ones that aren't interested weren't interested from the start.  FWIW, adding some mineral oil to a cat's wet food is welcome by all of mine, so to the extent one of the cats don't take the petromalt, the mineral oil helps to keep the hairball situation under control.  Mineral oil is odorless and tasteless, so I don't get the fascination with it, but cats will be cats. . . .",3
Cat won't eat it unless I put it on him to lick it off. It's hard to herd s cat.,3
Car licks it off my finger.  It's very fresh so has a texture easy for her to lick off my finger.,3
"Really works & stops the hairball barfing.  One cat will lick it off my fingers, the other has to be forced.  Just different cats.  It is NOT the products fault the cats don't like it",3
Have had many kitty companions over the years. Have never had one that didn't love this stuff! Had a problem finding it locally and they wouldn't touch the other brans. So glad I found this again!,3
My cat loves this stuff! It's great for her hair balls. She only likes the malt flavor and no other! I was buying it at the big pet store for double the price! It is much cheaper here! Expiration date is good until 2020! I am very happy with my purchase.,3
"Can't speak as to its effectiveness, and my cat wouldn't touch the stuff.",3
My cat rubs it all over my carpet instead of licking it off his paw or nose.,3
"Although we were hoping our cat would lick it from the tube, its perfectly fine that we smear it on her paws to lick it off. Its nice and thick",3
"My kittens LOVE this stuff!  Literally it is the only one that I've tried that they don't freak out when I try to give it to them.  I don't know why, but I'm sold!",3
My kitties can't live without this!  No more hair balls in my house.,3
This is the only one product that really works and I have tried thousands of them. Very happy with the purchase and very happy with the results.,3
"My cats don't like this and wouldn't eat it but then, they are kinda fussy.",3
"As promised it is as firm and more like the original. Unfortunately, my last few generations of cats sure don't like it....I'm not sure why previous cats loved it, I assume new ways of making it...don't know BUT, this is not like the runny stuff I've bought in recent years, which is good. It's easier to put on my kitty's paw for him to lick off, and whether he likes it or not, it does keep him hairball free",3
Very effective!  A combination of Petromalt and a good brushing stopped daily vomiting due to hairballs. Kitty thanks you!,3
The original gel formula. Hard to find and cats love it.,3
My cat (large main coon) with long hair won't even lick it.  Course he is picky...tried others.  So far the cheapest in store works same for him.,3
"I don't have a cat, just a dog that will eat just about anything.  At the advice from my veterinarian, I keep Petromalt on hand in case my not so smart, but well loved dog eats things that are really bad for him. He loves the taste too.",3
Works great for both my long hair and short hair cats. They love the taste too!,3
Can't find this locally anymore and it's the only one my cats will eat. Great product that helps with hairballs!,3
"This is the thick, original kind of Petromalt that doesn't drip and ooze every time you try and use it.  One cat eats it out of the tube as a treat, the other tolerates it, but that's her behavior with all Petromalt type products.  All in all, it's great because it doesn't make a mess of the cat, my hands, the surface the cat is sitting on when she's dosed, etc.",3
Cats use this when needed for hairballs or indigestion as well.,3
"I really like these (I got three different colors) but the sizing is off. A small usually fits my dogs just fine. This ran big. By the time I adjusted it the wording was obscured so that one reads ""dog"" one reads ""nerv"" and one reads ""ly""... otherwise they are fine. I got matching harnesses so I feel that the obscured wording isn't as big of a deal, but without the harness no one would know what the colors say. An extra-small size would have worked better, but small is the smallest offered. Good color and quality though.",3
"Just perfect! I got three different colors/words all in the small for my Jack-Russel/Rat Terrier mix and my two Rat Terriers. They fit all three perfectly. It's bright, well made, and enough padding that they comfy in it. Unlike the other 2 I ordered, the green ""friendly"" one has a ring on the harness at the back and on the front too. The yellow and white only have d-rings on the back. Really worked out great for my needs. Very happy with my purchase. My dogs are all different sizes from 10 lbs to 20 and different heights, neck and girth, but the small fit all 3 beautifully. I'm delighted with the purchase and glad I decided to splurge on these and the matching collars. Even my nervous dog who refuses to move if you try to put anything on her is comfy in her new halter and really doesn't seem to mind wearing it at all!",3
It fit my dog perfectly. He finds it very comfortable to wear. Now I don't have to worry about people approaching him and him reacting! Thanks for making a great product!,3
"This fit my dog exactly - he is at the top of the measurements for a size small and it is almost snug, but still fits. My only complaint is that the buckle is in the corner of where his leg meets his body - the armpit, if you will. I can't imagine that is comfortable, but he still runs and moves normally. Other than that I love it! Very sturdy and is easier to put on him than other vests I've tried.",3
This fits weird on my true to size small dog (8lb rat terrier) I had to sew this to fit her correctly and avoid slipping off her neck area. Overall high quality product would buy again..,3
small. great fit for my 14lb papillon. dogs with wider heads may have trouble fitting into the neck hole of this style as it is not adjustable. she likes it. bright. sturdy. shows well on a furry dog.,3
"Perfect! I went back and forth on the sizing and finally ordered a large for my 45 pound lab/border collie mix. Smaller would have been way too small.  The large perfectly fits anything small lab, border collie, heeler or pitbull sized. If your dog is anything around that size make sure to get the large!",3
I like this harness however the metal clip of my dog's leash comes unclipped from the top of the harness very easily. All I have to do is move slightly to the side and the metal clip slips right off which could definitely be quite dangerous for some dogs that would run off if unhooked. Luckily my dog stays with me when I unhook her so it's not as big of a deal for me. I also prefer to leash her collar anyway. I mostly got this to ward off people who insist on petting my fearful dog despite her alarm barks.,3
great looking harness my dog really stands out when out on walks. my dog gets nervous and will try to run away from approaching people or kids who try to pet him without permission so I hope this harness will help. ( my dog after a swim in the lake picture with the harness),3
"Just perfect! I got the green ""friendly"" harness in small for my Jack-Russel/Rat Terrier mix and it fits her perfectly. It's bright, well made, and enough padding that she is comfy in it. Unlike the other 2 I ordered, this one has a ring on the harness at the back and on the front too. Really worked out great for my needs, I only wish they had one that was for seizures-- but this will let people know it's safe to approach her to read her dog ID tag which does alert that she has seizures, is on medication, and not to feed her. Very happy with my purchase. I also got the blind dog (white) and nervous dog (yellow). Very happy with all three. My dogs are all different sizes from 10 lbs to 20 and different heights, neck and girth, but the small fit all 3 beautifully. I'm delighted with the purchase and glad I decided to splurge on these and the matching collars. Even my nervous dog who refuses to move if you try to put anything on her is comfy in her new halter and really doesn't seem to mind wearing it at all!",3
I have three rescue dogs; one of which is actually friendly!  I bought the small green friendly harness for my 15 pound Pekingese and the small red caution for my 12 pound Pekingese mix. The small is adjustable and fits My heavier dog perfectly!,3
Great collar.  Now I don't feel I have to explain about my Swee' Pea every time we go out!,3
THE PLASTIC SNAP IS TOO LARGE - TOO BIG FOR A LITTLE DOG LIKE MY SHI TZU MAY BE OK FOR A LARGE DOG...NOT A LITTLE ONE.,3
"The quality, color, and so forth are fine. The collar size seems to run big though. By the time I adjusted it the word was obscured. Not a big deal for me since I got the matching harness, but if I were relying only on the collar the purpose would be lost with only the partial wording showing. Otherwise quite happy with the items. A size extra small would be a fine option.  The three small collars I bought were for a Jack Russel/Rat Terrier mix (20 lbs), a Rat Terrier (15 lbs), and a Rat Terrier (10 lbs)... all different heights, sizes, weights-- still the collar was even too big for the largest of the three without obscuring the embroidered wording. I'm happy with the quality though and only regret the way the wording worked out.",3
"sizing is WAY off, I can't make it small enough for my 18lb American Eskimo.  didn't try to return it as I had already taken it out of the package and adjusted everything and had him walk in it a little bit.  it sits in a bag, will probably send it to one of my favorite rescue groups to give to another foster dog.",3
"Fantastic!  My dog wasn't accustomed to walking on a leash before I adopted him.  After a couple of days on the harness, Logan loves walking beside me in my power wheelchair.",3
I bought this because I train my dog in public places (park and sidewalk) and this harness really does the trick so he would not be disturbed by other people with or without dogs during his training. The shipping was fast and it came exactly as described.,3
it fits a little tight around her neck and there is no adjusting.  But it is just as pictured and came right on time,3
I have purchased a couple of these as dogs have grown.  It has cut down people trying to interact with them during training.,3
"I'm giving this harness three stars because the neck is not adjustable.  It slips over the head leaving no room for growth.  I bought the small for my puppy as he is in training.  It fits well right now and is comfortable, but it will not work for him in another month or two as the neck is one piece without any adjustment.  The material is durable and if you are buying this for a full grown dog, it will work well for you.  Thank you.",3
"I LOVE this product!  We have a newly adopted Plott Hound and she is a bit intimidating to some.  She has a big bark and unique coloring and has some anxiety while approaching other dogs.  With this harness people have been much more accommodating in their reactions to her behavior as we work with her in public since the harness makes the message clear that she is in the midst of a learning process.  It has also deterred people from barreling right up to pet her without asking which has made it much easier on us as owners to be able to introduce her to people slowly.  I don't clip a leash to this harness so I can't attest to it's performance in that area, but my dog has been able to wear this for 5-mile walks with no chafing or overheating.  Solid purchase!",3
"Kept looking for a Vest that said, ""Adopt me"" for my foster dog and I thought that I would try this harness instead. It is well made. Soft. Thicker than expected. Easy to adjust. It did the job and she got adopted by an amazing family just a few weeks later! I am going to buy these in every size for future pooches!",3

Brightly colored. The ""adopt me"" text is easy to read.  Runs small. Medium fits a large cat sized animal (see video). Large fits a medium dog or largish dog with a small head, but not a typical large dog (too small for an English Bulldog's head, for example).  The collar is not adjustable, but the chest belt is.",3
"Very easy to get on a wiggly dog. A bit cheaply made. I wouldn't trust it on a strong puller despite the adjustable fit. Still, a great way to draw attention to foster dogs!",3
Super cute harness! It seems comfortable for my foster pup. I will continue to use this for future puppies. I just bought the blue training harness for my personal dog. I think these are great!!,3
"I have only used this on my pup three times thus far but wow what a difference it makes when it comes to keeping my pup focused on training. It repels most people (and their kids!)  from approaching or making any sort of contact with my dog and this helps reduce distractions for him. This vest seems to train others (including myself) besides my dog in regards to keeping space between their dogmas my dog that are unknown to each other. The vest I got for my pup is small and is adjusted to its smallest fitting leaving enough space for him to grow into. He is about 15 inches in height and weights 13.5 lbs. My pup only wears this to train not to play or rough house in so I am hoping it will last a good while. It is ""over the head"" to get on but there is plenty of room that my pup is not freighten to put it on. There is a loop on the back and also on the chest. It is a good looking vest and has become very handy in training my rambunctious terroir pup.",3
Nice harness... Wish it came in a bigger size other than medium because my puppy American Bulldog has almost grown out of it already.,3
I foster dogs and volunteer for a rescue.  This is okay if you put it on when the dog is wearing a shirt.  I only use this at adoption events and dogs get very excited at events.  It rubbed one of the dogs armpit and made it bleed.  I use slip leads and wasn't this as a harness.,3
Great visibility and it stood up to a half wild puppy who did NOT want to have a harness on.,3
It's a very cute and eye catching product however it's not durable. I had a Catahoula in the medium sized one and it ripped on the seam within 30 minutes of wearing it. I had to put an Easy Walk harness on as well to keep control of the dog.,3
"This great product for the price.  I have a 4 month old lab pup that is being socialized  in public for service dog work.  It holds up pretty well.  The Rings are good size and sown well.  The mess is light weight.  The plastic closure is solid as well. I like having a ring on top of his back as well as on the front for tags.  I will buy another one in medium for later use.  Also the material does stretch and give,  so for us a longer wear time.",3
Fell apart quickly.  Halter fits loosely so it rotates on my small pup.  Training connection ring in front trips my dog because she is so short.  Good idea.  Bad execution.  Better than using her collar because she chokes less when she pulls on the leash.  The mesh part ripped away from the edging.,3
Ordered a small but it was too small. Would have cost more to return it. I wish there was sizing information before I order.,3
Pretty good but runs a little big. Wish id got an X-small for my 4 month old maltese mix,3
"I have been using this, it is my foster puppies first harness. IT works well, the lettering ""Adopt me"" seems to be a little too close together.  People miss read it all the time.",3
This worked great for a foster who could not wear a collar.,3
"The bright yellow grabs attention along with the dark contrast of the letters. As far as the vest is concerned, it feels a bit weak and I don't feel that they would last long if used extensively.  I have donated a few to a shelter where I volunteer. For dogs that pull strong, I either use a stronger vest along with this one for advertising, or along with a choke chain.  In either case, I don't rely on the vests loop unless you have a very well behaved dog or one that is very small.",3
Nice quality fits a number of body styles. Just wish it came on other colors.,3
Price Ehe. Potential adopter publicity priceless. Fit's as expected. Cleans up well after a beach day with a mild dish soap.,3
Purchased for my foster dog to wear at adoption events.  Great price and well made. Medium is perfect for 16lb Pomeranian.,3
"The neckline is a little too loose. It is elasticised, but when Buffy pulled on the leash, I thought it might come off.",3
"I tell my blind dog to get ready to tell the world you are blind and he knows we're going for a walk or a stroller ride! He LOVES this on his body. The mesh material breaths well and if fits perfect! He feels much more secure in it and when it's on him, he knows it's park time! The leash it comes with keeps him close to me and it gives him a great deal of confidence! He trusts walks MUCH more since I bought this....And this is my second! It's been quite the asset in re-training him!  My only wish is MAKE IT IN MORE COLORS!!! WHITE GETS DIRTY!! Give a blind dog owner some choices!",3
"UPDATE 12/7/17: Despite complaints from others that the harness starts fraying, mine hasn't. Of course, being white, it needs frequent washing because the wood floors at my office are always dirty from the foot traffic in and out from our warehouse.  I want to buy another one so that Harley has a spare to wear while one is being washed. (I usually have to wait several days to pile up enough bleachable whites to make a small load.  Also, he seems perfectly comfortable wearing it all day (as my semi-retired service dog, he has had years of wearing a  vest backpack; I'm sure that the harness is more comfortable.  Runs on the small side so you need to follow the measurement guide provided. I ordered a Small for my 22 lb slender-built cattle dog mix but the collar part that goes over the head was way too small. I returned it and ordered the medium, which fits him much better. The only improvement would be to pad the nylon webbing straps to prevent rubbing. Harley goes to work with me every day and he gets around so well that people forget he's blind. I'm hoping this harness will help remind people that he can't see them.",3
"This collar was very helpful when walking my elderly dog who became suddenly blind.  It clearly alerted other dog walkers to keep their dog away, rather than make the usual social contact.  It was relatively easy to put on and take off.  If your dog is blind, this will help them not be frightened by contact they cannot see coming.",3
"This harness fits wonderfully. I bought a couple to give them a chance to see if the other would have held up better. I would have given it 5 stars, but they've cut the fabric too close to the stitching line so it ends up tearing out. If this was corrected, it would rate 5 stars",3
"My cairn terrier lost his eyes to glaucoma.  I purchased this product shortly thereafter, and it has been very helpful to him and me as we make the transition to living with blindness.  My dog feels secure in this harness, and I love that it so boldly advertises his condition to other dog walkers.  I got a medium for my slightly plump aged cairn, and it fits perfectly.  It has been very durable.  I just ordered another so that I can switch them out to wash.  That shows how highly I regard this product.",3
Well made. Recommend. Medium is like an extra large on my 8 pound chihuahua.,3
We bought it for our blind dog that runs on our farm so visitors will know she is blind and to watch out for her!,3
"This harness is the sturdiest of all the harnesses I've seen.  It fits her snugly and durable.  The plastic clasp is durable, easy to snap and unsnap.  I would recommend this to anyone needing a way to identify a blind dog.",3
We ordered this and an adopt me harness.  Both are well made.  Fast shipping.  Updating this and I meant to months ago. Within a week of buying the harness started to fray.  I emailed the seller and never got s response. The harness is usable but really frayed and worn looking. It's frayed so bad after 5 months of minimal use I went online for another and hope it is better made.,3
"Just perfect! I got three different colors/words all in the small for my Jack-Russel/Rat Terrier mix and my two Rat Terriers. They fit all three perfectly. It's bright, well made, and enough padding that they comfy in it. Unlike the other 2 I ordered, the green ""friendly"" one has a ring on the harness at the back and on the front too. The yellow and white only have d-rings on the back. Really worked out great for my needs. Very happy with my purchase. My dogs are all different sizes from 10 lbs to 20 and different heights, neck and girth, but the small fit all 3 beautifully. I'm delighted with the purchase and glad I decided to splurge on these and the matching collars. Even my nervous dog who refuses to move if you try to put anything on her is comfy in her new halter and really doesn't seem to mind wearing it at all!",3
"We had been using the ""blind dog"" leash. Decided to add the vest because many people didn't notice the leash.",3
Helps with people coming up and scaring her as they see in advance that she is blind.,3
This has worked like a charm! No more mothers allowing their small kids to just run at my caution girl!,3
"I didn't look too closely at the description on this harness, and was skeptical about reviews saying how sturdy it is, but I've been proven wrong. The words are embroidered on very nicely- they aren't going to wear off, like I was expecting. The harness itself isn't thin mesh or something, it's padded (cotton? Idk) enough that it'd not going to rip.  I have three things to say for prospective buyers: First, is your dog long-haired? If so, and you want this harness for the words (caution, nervous, etc), skip it. Their fur will cover up the message (my dog has short-to-medium fur and some of the fur on her neck folds over the edges of the harness). Try a leash instead maybe.  Second, the reason I'm only giving this harness four stars is that the back ring ripped off. the stitching on the straps is still fine (how did that happen), but the ring? somewhere in my backyard. We ate dinner outside one night, with my dog on her tie-out cable, she got caught around a post, jumped down a 4-foot wall... we heard her go 'oof' and then she ran off into the neighbor's yard, free as a bird. Still haven't found the back ring, but I didn't care about it in the first place, so. :O not really a problem for me  Third: this works well as a front-attaching, no-pull harness! The front ring is in a good position, just high enough on my dog's neck for me to clip it to my her collar (for safety) at the same time when we go for walks. She's pulled and sometimes lunged and jerked the end of the leash, but the front ring is still there.  I'm very happy that I can use this just like her other harnesses and keep the kiddos away until we can work on her fear aggression;;; It was a good investment :')",3
"The Caution harness is exactly what I was looking for. My dog is very timid when people are around. Most people approach dogs without asking and this is the perfect way to let people know they should proceed with ""caution"". The letters are big and noticeable, exactly what I was looking for!",3
"I bought this harness for my 10 pound, very small mini schnauzer.  She is very cute, but not friendly to strangers, and I wanted a way of warning people not to not just reach down and pet her.  This harness seems to do the trick, even if they do think it is a joke.  It fits her very comfortably, and doesn't rub anywhere, and sometimes she just wears it around.  I keep it somewhat loose because of her longer fur on the bottom, but she hasn't managed to slip it, and believe me when she sees a rabbit she tries.  It is easy to put on, the head slips into the opening, and one arm goes through an arm hole, then the rest of it snaps snuggly around the chest.  This is great because she gets over excited and struggling with other harnesses I have had was very challenging.",3
"Needs to be made much, MUCH bigger for dogs with long hair and then of course the words need to be made much bigger TOO!! No one's going to see it from a distance, esp. from behind --and not the front either-- when dogs with short legs and long hair are walking.",3
I feel much more comfortable forewarning people my dog has issues. The harness is of great quality as well.,3
I have a 10 pound Pekingese mix - the small harness could be adjusted to fit her tiny little body. I feel an XS would be a better fit but this will do the trick.  I love the caution label.... Hoping it will prevent any unwanted attention and explains that my dogs are rescues and are more scared and nervous than friendly to people and other dogs.,3
Feeling much better about walking my dog! These warning harnesses are such a good idea.,3
"i have 4 dogs and 3 currently have the Soresto collar.  2 of the dogs seem to be tick free, but still have fleas which have migrated to their rear end (the farthest point from the collar).  the 3rd dog has both fleas and an occasional tick., the last tick i found was up by the ears.  all 3 dogs were bathed and gone over to make sure there were no fleas or ticks on them prior to putting the collar on.  the 4th dog, (who is nursing puppies) currently has no type of medication or flea collar and ironically is flea and tick free.....",3
"My dog was suffering from fleas due to a stray cat...24 hours and this had them all gone....no more fleas or ticks. Unlock drops or pills this is 8 months and I can remove it to end it if it made my dog sick. Cant undo a pill or drops, and none of them last 8 months like this. Well worth the money.",3
"great price if you subscribe, same price as most places other wise.  Make sure and leave the recommended room so the meds don't irritate the dogs skin. Works 6-8 months depending on your dogs activity with water or baths",3
"best product ever for ticks and fleas.  Warning, it did make my friend's dog quite ill, so beware.  I have not had any problems with 3 of my dogs. Glad I found this on a deal, cuz the price can be high",3
Almost at the six month mark and no tics or fleas.,3
This seems to work great on my dog.  No more scratching problems.,3
It only took a week until our lab had managed to scratch his collar off and now I have no protection for him. And I am out all that money. I guess I will go back to Frontline. I never had this problem with the other tick collar I used to use but they quit making it. Very disappointed. I followed the instructions exactly when putting it on.,3
"It works on my thick, heavy coated, medium 50# sized dog. Second purchase for us, because the first one worked so well. Also use the small for our 7# dog. No sickness or problems of any kind. Grateful to have found them. We replaced the first round at 8 months. Havent seen a flee for almost a year.",3
This collar is by far the best. I one time used Hartz brand flea and tick killer and my dog got so sick. This keeps the fleas and ticks away and lasts for so long. Ill never use anything else.,3
Do your dog a favor and purchase this collar!! It lasts 8 months and in the two years we've purchased the collar our dog has bee flea and tick free!! No monthly application messes!,3
"This seems to work well for our big dog.  Apparently, it's activated by movement.  Has taken care of fleas all summer last year, so we bought another.",3
I use these collars every year and they are fantastic. I have two large dogs (Weimaraners) that love to be outside and I have never seen a single tick or flea on them since I began using these. The collars also have never irritated their skin. I do make sure they do not get very wet.,3
"I bought this on the advice of my vet. The fleas in my area (eastern North Carolina) are apparently resistant to Frontline and other medications which use the same active ingredients, so even though I was treating her regularly with a topical, my dog got fleas at doggy daycare. After treating her with Capstar, a fast acting and effective but short term oral flea medication, I put this on her and we haven't seen any fleas since. I like that it lasts so long and I will definitely purchase this again.",3
"Assuming this works as described, it feels like a winner to me.  I just put them on two dogs who spend a good amount of time outside.  For eight months of coverage, the price of this plus a heartworm med is very favorable over Revolution.  It works very well, but I hate the chemical odor and the greasy feel of their coats, and I'm not nuts about the price tag of Revolution.",3
Chose to return and go back to Trifexis and a tick puller.  I didn't use it but the people at the dog park I go to say it only lasts about 5 months.,3
Bought this collar for my 1 yr old 65 lb Blue Heeler from a local pet store . Put it on him at noon yesterday 4/29/2018 .. by 9 am today 4/30/2018  he was sluggish and lathargic . Not playing ball or with his other fur brothers . Not himself at all .. only thing that had changed and new is this damn collar . Took it off him immediatly and 8 hours later he is back to his normal self,3
"Held off getting one of these because we were afraid of the chemicals. After our dog contracted lyme (we live in one of the worst states) we realized checking her everyday and using the behind the scruff drops was not enough. This collar works fantastic, even if a tick gets on her it shrinks and dies seemingly right away  If you live in a bad state (PA for us), and have a long haired dog (GSD) this might be a must have",3
I buy these every year here and they have always preformed really well with our yard being a flea haven and all.,3
"do not use, we used on our Italian Mastiff and she died 3 months later. After we put in on her , she got sick diarrhea/vomiting and severe weight loss. Only thing that was changed was we used the collar. Vet said she couldn't find out what was wrong but dog had to be put down.",3
"Wow, works wonderfully.  I recently moved from a non tick area to the hills in Tennessee, and as soon as it stopped snowing the ticks came out.  Even though I have my dog on vet prescribed once a month flea, tick, heartworm etc she still was coming in with TICKS.  Second day after I put this collar on her....no more ticks.  I do watch her closely for any adverse effects as other posters have mentioned, but all is good.  Love this collar!!!",3
"These collars work very well on our Great Pyrenees dogs. I worried that fleas or ticks might be able to hide in their heavy fur, but not when they're wearing a Seresto collar! It's been eight months, and no sign of anything, and our area is full of ticks! I ordered more collars for this year!",3
This was our first time using Seresto with our two goldendoodles. Weve used other products such as frontline and K9 Advantix but didn't like the topical treatment and the way it leaves their coat greasy. So far we really like the collar. Although we did find a tick near my dogs eye about two weeks after we started them with the collar! We will continue to use the collar. It was recommended by our vet as well!,3
Ended up not using because I read the small print that they shouldn't sleep in your bed with this. Finding a better way.,3
Have used on my dog for years and it works well.,3
I travel with my horses and dog.  We go into tick and flea territory.  I can honestly say since using this collar the last two years my dog has remained flea and tick free,3
These are the best. I was skeptical about using a collar style rather than the liquid. But I'm on my second set of collars and find nothing on 2 very active outside farm dogs. Worth every penny.,3
"My healthy 6 year old dog was shaking from head to toe 6 hours after applying. He was not cold, we have never seen him do this, just laying on the couch his whole body shaking. Took the collar of immediately. Issue resolved and had not returned. I've since read that this collar can cause seizures. We want nothing to do with this product!!",3
These collars work great on our pets and we have no flea problems at all.,3
"We used this collar for our Australian Shepherd and found ticks on her constantly.  One was even right underneath the collar! Thankfully, we don't live in an area where tick's that carry Lyme disease are prevalent, because she'd probably have Lyme!  These collars should be recalled.",3
The Commercial sums it up quite well! Works great month 1!!!,3
Great adjustable length for growing 5-months old puppy.  1/3 less the price than at the vets office...go Amazon Prime!,3
Works well.  This is my 2nd year with these and I have not seen a flea.  Topicals had stopped working for me after many years.,3
Really worked last year. 2 dogs 2 cats on open pasture to loafer means bad flea and a few ticks non stop. Drops on neck worked 2 weeks if lucky. The dog dose and cat ingredents are the same and same amount. So I get 2 large and cut in 1/2 used on dog and 1 cat. The other 2 cats get 1/2 each. I had given up hope on stopping fleas former Chihuahua breeder and past shower. I had gone through any medicine made for fleas. Nothing worked till Adnantage by Bayer. It worked 5 years till fleas mutated. Seresto is same maker. And it kicked flea rear. My cats go through our pasture and 2 others with woods near hunting mice. 2  are Huge Main Coon nutered. The other a 1/2 MC and persian so slower and more lazy So no suprise birds. Just a few mice a week. And THANK YOU BAYER no fleas.,3
"We haven't even had the collar for one month and lost it. I am 100% sure that I put it on the right way but it still fell off (and got very lose) a couple of times. I never attempted to take it off myself, neither did my dog. We live in an apartment and only have one dog, so he doesn't have a crazy life where he is likely to lose it.  I am just SUPER sad and disappointed because I heard good things about the collar and did not even get one full out of 8 months worth it. Also, it's like losing 70$ on the street, which hurts as a college student.",3
"The only brand that had worked for my dog so far, poor thing is allergic to fleas and breaks out.",3
"It didn't even last 2 days on my dog, the collar snapped and my dog chewed it up :( I didn't get a chance to even test it out.",3
I have been using the Seresto collar for about 4 years now on my lab. Great results. Keeps ticks away,3
"I bought this one from Amazon in December, 2017.  At the end of January, I put on it on my dog Icee and...so far it's working as the label indicated which I am really HAPPY about.  It's expensive, but I feel if it last three or four months, I'm ahead of the game, cost wise.  The reason I didn't give it more then 3 stars is because... I bought another one for my other dog Miles, same brand name but from a major pet store not to far from me.  This one I'm struggling to get thru it's second month.  Pretty pricey for two months protection...wished I still had the receipt for it.  Nice thing about buying from Amazon, is that they have records of your orders which eliminates that problem.",3
I have been using these collars for just about a year and a half.  My one dog really really hated the drop type flea and tick.  i would put it on him and he would avoid me for days.  Whatever it was he really hated it.  So to that end i would not always give him the drops or i would forget.  He spends a lot of time out side and has had flea and tick issues in the past.  BUT not in the last 2 years that i have been using these collars.  He doesnt mind at all and has had no adverse reactions.  People were also concerned about human exposure to the chemicals in the collars.... we have had no issues.  Both of my dogs sleep in the bed and they both have the exact same collar.  We have had ZERO issues.  My female did show a little redness on her neck when i first put the collar on her but that went away fairly quickly.  Now there are no issues.  These appear to work as advertised and I am satisfied with the product.,3
Didn't work for my dog!  I don't know why but it made NO difference with our flea problem.  A waste of money totally!,3
"Our three labs have them on and so far so good! One has had his on for about a month and the other two only days but it is beginning to be flea and tick season and we want them to be protected early. The one who has had his for a month does not have any flea dirt, fleas or ticks and we check him all the time.  We have also looked for any skin reactions and there are none on any of them. We are very happy with this product and price wise, it's a good deal since it will last up to 8 months",3
"These have worked really well for my 2 dogs and I don't think I'd switch back to the liquid version ever. The collar is easy to put on, you don't need to remember monthly and it lasts all the warm/flea/tick season months. I put them on early-mid spring and leave them on right into winter and they have not had a single bug since they've worn them. They go swimming/paddle boarding with me and they get bathed usually once or twice a month with no issue.",3
"Yes, it is pricey. But it is worth every penny. It is the most effective flea and tick product out there and lasts at least eight months as advertised.",3
These are amazing.  We battled fleas and even with treating the yard and house each month as well as the animal we still had fleas.  Tried the collar on one dog and no fleas.  Now all the dogs and indoor cats have them on and after a full year of use we have not had to treat the house or yard after about the third month.  Well worth the investment.  No issues with senior dogs (ages 2 years to 17 years) and cats (20 and 17 years).,3
Put one on my Golden every 6 months.  Keeps the bugs off him.,3
"Love this collar for my dogs and 1 cat. They had no  negative reactions. All I say is when you put it on them just take notice of any behavioural changes, like over scratching at the neck or lethargy. My other cat couldn't wear one because she constantly tried to chew the collar off, so it was the liquid form for her.",3
We have a lot of ticks and this collar really works! High recommend it!,3
i have been using these for several years. these are the best flea and tick collar i have ever seen!!!,3
"one for the dog, one for the cat, no problems, no fleas almost a month now, very satisfied so far.",3
2nd time I've purchased... Last season didn't see a single flea or tick on my dog.  I will continue to buy again,3
"My Great Pyrenees has been wearing these year round for about 5 years. I only replace the collar once a year, when Spring is around the corner and then leave it on her for 8 months, remove it or leave it on. My Pyr has incredibly sensitive skin and every year before this she got hot spots which i believe were in combination with getting fleas, even if only a few bites. She hasn't had fleas since i got her on this collar. She is a total furball, and the collar sits just under her tagged collar, so its not noticable and she has never acted anything but indifferent to the whole experience.",3
No fleas. Maybe it works. Always did for my cats. Dog scratches less too.,3
this works ...  although there is a concern for an allergic reaction ... as always you need to watch . i like this better than front line and advantix . this is our second year using this product,3
"We've used these for a few years now and they actually work great. My cats kept getting bad fleas from the outdoor dogs, and it seemed like no amount of topical treatments would work. Once the collars went on all 4 animals, no more fleas or ticks. Our vet recommended these, but said to keep them dry, because once wet their potency is drastically reduced.",3
"This is the 3rd year I've gone with a Seresto collar. The last 2 years they have performed flawlessly - no ticks, and around here many dogs get Lyme disease.",3
"This collar has eliminated our flea problem after years of vacuuming and skin treatment falling short. Even stopped treating my cat for the cold season. I do worry about the chemicals, however! I recommend this product and always washing hands after touching your furry companion.",3
"Ive been using these collars for a few years now on my lab and coonhound, and they're very effective, durable and long-lasting. For us, its a much better product than the back applicators ...I don't have to worry about them rubbing themselves on the furniture or carpet to get it off.",3
8 months is a good time for this collar to work...will check it often..actually will check the dog often...thanks,3
"We have three small dogs and one large dog, and this makes the third time Ive ordered a Seresto collar for them to protect them from fleas and ticks.  These collars really work!  In the 2 1/2 years weve been using these collars we have not seen the first flea or tick on ANY of our dogs.  We have a grandbaby that is now crawling around our house and its even more important now than its ever been, if I didn't know for certain that these collars were great I wouldnt take the chance.  They have no odor to them, they're not greasy, they don't irritate my pets skin or fur.  And I can put them on and forget about them for the full eight months.  And they do truly last the full eight months.. Ive replaced these exactly on the eight month anniversary each time and they're still working great every time.. Ill be back in eight more months to buy again!",3
"My 10 yr old ""doodle"" has used this for 2 years and had NO TICKS OR FLEAS....period. Our new puppy, 4 months old is going to use this one. After clearing it with the vet. I told him of the very good results with my first dog and he said the puppy can use it as well. OK. But both MUST HAVE HEARTGUARD because it does not protect the dog from heart worm disease.",3
"I'm sure that for some dogs this works great. My dog had a severe allergic reaction to it. Her face swelled up. Vet bills. I removed and threw away the collar immediately, and Amazon was kind enough to refund me the full amount paid. Just thought I'd let people know of the possibility.",3
"Fortunately for my cat, I took this off when I saw her with very low energy level and came here to read the reviews. I purchased one for my dog and took it off after 1 week! OMG this company is evil. Bayer also make chemicals that kill honey bees. They don't care about your pets; they just want to make money.",3
"These seem to be doing what they are intended to do,Great !!.",3
This has worked great! I have had it on my dog since Oct and haven't seen a bug on him.,3
"Best defense against fleas & ticks, works for a long time & well worth the money",3
Have  used these protective collars on our two dogs with great success for the past four years. They will continue to be our preferred protection system.,3
The Seresto collar has worked great.  I use on my dogs and no longer have fleas spreading to my indoor cats or anywhere else in my home.  I think this ends up being cheaper and more effective than other topical liquid products.  I put them on dogs a little looser and then remove for baths.  The collars have lasted the full eight months for me with issue.  I have recommended to others who also were impressed with product.,3
So far great. No rashes. Dog isn't reacting to it. Haven't seen a single flea or tick on him thus far and I live in a high deer tick area. Definitely will buy again,3
"My vet recommended this due to frequent ticks. So far, I know still winter and cold, its been good. Ive had it on for 1 month, fits my 55 pound bulldog just fine, not irritating, no residues, no smell, no fleas, or ticks seen. Updates as months of hot weather approach.",3
"While it works, it works well.  However, Soresto eight months goes by very quickly... like in six months.  I noticed my dog scratching and biting her butt six months into my first Soresto collar.  It was definitely flea activity.  I replaced it with another Soresto collar.  Now, this one has lasted six months and we are seeing no flea activity, but.. IT'S MARCH.  Pretty sure I could put her out, bare-fur naked with no collar and a advertisement for a flea circus and she'd have no fleas.  Still, it does work while it works and it is one of the least expensive, safe options for flea and tick treatment.",3
My dogs wore these last year spring to fall and not one tick or flea found. He Little refector clips are a nice bonus.,3
"I've been using for 2 years now. It says it lasts 8 months but I get a year out of them. Excellent collar. Does not leave a film on the dogs neck or body. No powder, or smell. Very effective with ticks and fleas. I live in the Northeast and my backyard is loaded with ticks but they stay clear of my dogs with this collar.",3
This collar works brilliantly. I live in the woods where there are a lot of deer tics. My dog doesn't have any on him whilst he has this collar on.  No side effects. Great Price esp for one that actually lasts this long. Just take off when bathing your pup and it will last the time it states.,3
Love how this color works! I order this last year and my dog who is 60lbs never got a tick on her! I ordered it again for this year! Thank you for an awesome product!,3
ever since they came out ive brought one for my 5yr old fur baby they are wounderful shes never ever had fleas or ticks the soresto is the best thing Bayer has made for cats and dogs definatly worth it They Work !!,3
"I'm not happy that the price went up $10 since last year, but these collars are still well worth it, and considering I only buy them once a year I can't complain.  I live on 80 wooded acres and the ticks are horrible.  I buy one of these collars for each of my dogs at the end of winter and they are tick free all year.  When we first moved here we tried every brand of drops available and they didn't work.  These really work.  If only I could find something that worked as well for humans.",3
"Summer of 2017 I had the worst experience with fleas. I live in Pennsylvania and I was treating my house weekly. I spent and wasted so much money on treatments, bombs, sprays, etc. Not anymore. These collars are expensive, but worth it. People have talked about their dogs getting rashes from the collars but my Australian Shepherd has no issues. His breeder uses them on her dogs too and no issues so I'm not sure if maybe the dogs having this problem had sensitive skin or what but the collar caused no problems for my dog or cats.",3
"I have to use two at the same time on my Great Pyrenees  I add new collars every 4 months and throw away the oldest of the two.  Before I started doing that, the fleas congregated on their tails..",3
Worthless! I was so disappointed and worse I let my dogs suffer for over a month on the off chance it would start to work. I am one guilty furbaby mom :( ... don't waste your money,3
This is the second Seresto flee collar Ive bought for a dog with thick hair. None of the topical flee meds have worked this thick haired dog but the Seresto gives him peace from flees.,3
"This was the only flea treatment that worked this past year, and fast. I was nervous after reading some horror stories but we had a lot of luck with it and no problems. It doesn't have the gross smell of the white flea collars , which is also a bonus .",3
"All this is a dipped plastic in chemicals. It just protects the neck area, gave my bulldog a rash.",3
Works great. I like that I don't have to feed my dog a dangerous pill. My dog used to always get ticks and he hasn't had one since I bought this collar. It actually repels them. It is amazing,3
I have a 55lb dog with a very thick coat. We live in FL. We adopted her from our local shelter. She loves to lay in the grass. Unfortunately there are fleas in the grass. I bathed her with the Dawn vinegar and water mixture but that was just a temporary fix. This collar actually works!  This is our second collar. Very happy with the product.,3
This collar worked great but my bulldog developed an allergy to it and a rash formed around his neck where the collar lay on his skin and his hair fell out in a perfect circle. I loosened it hoping that would help but it didnt. I don't recall seeing him scratch at it or showed signs of irritation. I was so bummed because they are expensive and we didn't get a chance to finish the collars effective time frame. On to something else.,3
"I put this collar on my dog yesterday and today I found 2 ticks on her! I am surprised at all of the positive responses. And I am shocked that I paid over $50 for this collar. What a waste! If I spray my dog with tick repellant it works, but this collar is a joke. I am not happy about what I paid, I had high hopes.",3
"SUPER expensive, but it works.  Without it, I was picking 30 ticks off doggie.  Now she comes home with one or two.",3
"This is my 3Rd  year. We live in tickville. My dogs were diagnosed with a tick illness  (not lyme) it causes red blood cell problems and bleeding.  Almost lost one of them. After they recovered, we bought these. Have not found any ticks on them and we test yearly for tick diseases. None have been found!  Love these. My dogs are Golden Retrievers, 5 and 11 years old.",3
So far I have never seen a tick or flea even at the 8 month point.,3
"This is the only thing that works on the bizarre critters in my wooded/lawned yard. I use one on one of the pets and it seems to keep pests away from all three pets. I picked the dog to put the collar on vs one of the two kitties because she's badly allergic to flea bites. Even though she's got stupid sensitive skin, it doesn't seem to bother her at all. I had it on for a full month and took it off easier than I thought it would come off to give her a bath.  Cons: okay I'll just say it, it's pretty ugly. It also hangs weirdly and not near her collar, I'll probably try to figure out a way to attach it to her actual collar. Also it needs to be removed once monthly for her grooming and bath so I have no idea if pulling it apart every time will make it weaker or what. It sort of attaches like a really weak zip tie.",3
"This is my third time buying Seresto collars. They worked extremely well the first two times, but didn't work this time. I ended up buying Capstar",3
I think its impssible for anything to work 100% but noticed less ticks on my dog with this and great price,3
"Last summer was flea city and we tried everything to get rid of them. Bug bombs, foggers, every other flea collar known to man, flew baths, exterminator, any home pest treatment you could imagine, and the only thing that worked was putting this on my pup.  Only then would they stop coming in on her. It was night and day. Unfortunately, that would be my pup's final summer with me and I'm glad she got to spend the majority of it rolling around in the back yard without having to spend hours itching afterward.",3
These work so much better than the application types. Never found a tick on my two dogs since we got these.,3
"Works well on my German Shepherd dog, lasts 8 months. My vet recommended this product.",3
"Very reliable tick and flea prevention. I have a small dog so I buy the extra large size and get two collars out of it. I wrap the second one well and place back in container, because these are pretty expensive. Have already done once. It didn't hurt my dog and it still worked after being stored.",3
I was really hoping I had found something that would finally work to kill my dogs fleas. I have tried topical with no results and decided to do rit this collar. Its been almost 3 days and my dogs still have fleas and still scratching like crazy. I had to actually take off one dog b cause she got a rash from the collar. Looks like I will have to go to the vet and get a oral prescription pill since those always worked in my the past but not easy to administer. Seems like this product works great for some people but I was not one of those lucky ones.,3
"Great Product. After using the popular brands of drops on the back of my dog, I found ticks on my two dogs daily - it was obviously time for a change. My vet and local pet shop suggested either pills or this collar. I prefered the collar. It is a superb product. Lasts 8 months (my Vet told me 6 to be safe) and really works. I would highly recommend.",3
"After a couple of months, did not repel or kill ticks.",3
"My dogs still have fleas two weeks after getting the collars. For the price, I wish I had just got Nexgard pills.",3
"I use this on my dog and recommend it to EVERYONE. We live in NH which is pretty much a tick palace. One weekend I found 8 ticks on my dog in a single day. We bought this collar, put it on, and didn't see another tick for months. We occasionally see a dead one every now and then.",3
"No idea how this gets any good reviews, bought one to test out on my two boxers, put it on one and can tell absolutely no difference in the amount of fleas they have. May have worked at one time but a totally waste of money. I would say not for dogs with serious flea exposures.",3
I have been using the collar on my Labrador for a year. Very happy with the performance of this collar. Did not have any issues with the dogs neck and did not bother her at all.,3
"These work great! We used to pick a few ticks off the dogs after every walk, but once we put this on, they never got any. It lasts several months. Great product!",3
These is a great flea collar. It works. It keeps my dogs free of fleas,3
"i think its working. i bought this product 4 months ago and returned it, but know I'm trying again.",3
Massive reaction on our dog's neck required veterinary care despite thick fur. Avoid. Would prefer to assign zero stars. Toxic as $#@!.,3
"One of the best purchases I've ever made. Cannot believe I've spent money and wasted time on any other flea/tick meds. Bite the bullet and buy this collar, you won't regret it.  I've seen ZERO fleas ever since the first collar I bought 2 years ago and what little ticks I do see on my beagle (who hunts and is outside/in the woods quite a bit) are dead.  Really took the worry out of flea and tick season for good!",3
I purchased this for our new puppy and used it for several weeks prior to writing this review.  This collar was recommended by a neighbor as an alternative to the flea combating liquid chemicals but we did not see any protection of fleas.  I ended up purchasing advantage which is what I use on my cat and it was much better.,3
Bought these highly rated collars to use on my three dogs for tick control in Southern Arizona.  All three dogs still had many ticks daily.  Very disappointing considering the ratings and the cost factor.  Gave up on collars and using Nexgard which is working very well to completely solve this problem.,3
"This is the only thing that combats the fleas in my area, nothing else works! Our indoor/outdoor cat tracks them in even in winter. Not even the vet prescribed stuff works. Our pup doesn't do water so it lasts about 7 months on her before I notice a few fleas here and there. As soon as we change her collar the fleas disappear.",3
"This is very economical and works very well - it kills all fleas.  I have purchased it about 6 times and I am always impressed with the performance.  Having said that, I have always had Great Danes with very short hair, but I recently got a Goldendoodle with very thick, curly, fur like a sheep.  I put the collar on him and it has killed MOST of the fleas.  He still has 6 or 8 a day that cluster right around his groin (which is far away from the collar).  I BELIEVE it is because the collar is not touching his neck because his fur is so thick.  Therefore 4 stars instead of 5.  I am contemplating shaving a channel in the hair on his neck so the collar will fit better, but that will look weird...",3
So far so good. Almost a month on my dog and I still see a flea or two a day. Has helped tremendously though.,3
Okay seriously $50 does it really need to cost 1/2 a Benjamin to keep fleas off your dog it works but there are several other flea collors that work just as good for $3,3
"It protected my 2 poodle mix dogs for 8 months and is still going strong. I will probably purchase again, but wish it was not so pricey.",3
"Packaging written in French, but highest quality product, will never use anything else again!",3
I have used this for my 4 cats and one dog for the past 2 years never saw another flea and no side effects.,3
"This is the only thing I've tried that gets all the fleas and ticks from my dog. He stopped scratching and biting himself. From all the bad reviews I've read, I thought this would have a bad reaction on my dog but it hasn't happened.",3
I purchase this item for all my dogs.  I would not trust anything else.,3
"With a massive explosion of ticks this summer, I was pleased to find that none were on my dog with the use of Seresto.  Last year we simply used K9 Advantix II each month and without fail, every month during those last 10 days before the next dose, we would find ticks on my dog's face.  No surprises this year- all ticks kept away from the Seresto collar. We didn't have an issue with fleas either. I'm quite pleased! Especially satisfied with the lack of smell that is usually associated with a recent application of topical preventative.",3
"I cant even tell you how many ticks we found in my dog after a walk this summer. So many we didn't even want to take our dog hiking (which is a hobby for us.) We aren't due for a new collar until january and Im finding fleas. Ive made sure her collar is tight enough. It hasn't been wet, but twice and very briefly (approximately 1-2 mins.) This is our 2nd or 3rd collar and this is the first one thats been horrible, but Im leary to even try it again!",3
"I ordered this and there is a sticker in the package with the date 01/2015. Not sure if this is when this collar was made or the expiration date. I put the collar on my dog and hopefully Ill know soon enough, as the fleas outside this time of year have been really bad. After every walk I end up finding one or two on her feet. I do like that the collar comes with reflectors you can attach for night walks. Hoping it works on the fleas though. Ive heard great things and my vet recommended it.",3
"Product does not work, I used it as directed and my dog still got infested with fleas...",3
"I had looked at these before, just another flea collar. Well my Jake is a big shepherd, not easy to bathe (I have a torn rotator cuff). Bathing did not seem to help the endless scratching, may have made it worse. I tried three different flea drops, no relief. Within three days of putting on the SERESTA collar, the scratching had STOPPED. We have noticed that BOTH cats have stopped scratching as well - we do not treat the cats.",3
Heard great things about these collars. Very disappointed. Very expensive and still found fleas on my dogs.,3
Have lots of dog clients.  near beach/ocean there were some fleas tearing them up.  neck/back flea treatments were not working/keeping up.  this collar knocks them out shortly after they jump on.  so yes works pretty great in flea infested locations.  Retirement center standard poodle was having problems with fleas as well.  internal and external applications were not able to keep up.  this collar seems to be knocking them out.,3
"I have bought these for years and this is the first year they did not work, but this is also the first year I bought them from Amazon.  It makes me wonder if they were out of date or something?",3
"My dog reacted badly to this collar.  After a few weeks, she was out-of-sorts, vomited (she almost never does), fought with dogs at her daycare (she never ever does) and bit one of the staff (NEVER bites humans, no matter what).  So we took the collar off and she went back to her sweet self.  Will give the collar to my daughter for her dog, who does well with it, but gets sick from Frontline, while we go back to Frontline.",3
I ordered 3 containers and they are mostly dust.  Do not order.,3
My dog likes them but they really aren't worth the price.,3
"My husky loved the treats, she has a sensitive stomach and tolerated this well with no upset tummy. Only complaint is that the tub was not even close to being full and very disappointing that there was so little amount of treats in the container. Will not repurchase due to the amount received for the price paid but no complaints on quality of treat.",3
"My puppy loves these treats, our trainer calls it ""puppy crack"" ;)",3
"I use this exclusively for training, my dog is attracted to the pleasant smell and loves the taste.  Using this product I have trained our puppy to sit, lay down, stay, fetch, loose leash walking and on a treadmill in a much shorter time than I anticipated.",3
"I ordered this thinking it was a bigger tub of treats - but it is tiny.  Dogs love it, but really stinky!",3
"I bought this to stuff into a bone puzzle.  Problem is the pieces are of all different sizes.  So, unless you are using this as a food extra to your dog's regular meal, I would not bother.  My dog did enjoy them.",3
My dog goes crazy for these!  He absolutely loves them. We are careful about what we feed him since he has had pancreatitis. He does fine on them. I cut the bigger pieces in half because he is a small dog. The crumbs I pour over his food!,3
The dogs say thanks for the quick delivery. I cut them up into bite size pieces to make them last longer.,3
"This tub was ridiculously difficult to open - we felt like idiots trying to get it open. The pup liked the treats, but it made our hands stink even after washing them. On the fence about this one.",3
My dog (maltese) loves them.  I do not buy them often because of price,3
Foxy the Pomeranian says this is one of her favorite treats  A wonderful brand,3
This seems to be working on both my dogs teeth.  I see an improvement and I've only been using it for about 2 weeks.,3
and has quit a lot of plaque on her teeth.  I think ingredients looks unsafe and will find something else that hopefully will give good results.,3
"We mix this with our dog's drinking water.  It helps to soften the tartar build up so that when she chews on hard treats or bones, the tartar can easily scrape off. It also makes it easier for us to brush her teeth.",3
"The java moss came in on time and was very green, no brown whats so ever. I love it!!!! Cant wait for it to grow!",3
My Macaw now has a perch she can sit and chew on.  Will order more of these when she demolishes this one,3
"I have 2 small perches for my Green Cheek Conure. One perch has 3 branches, the other is only a single branch. They're the right size for her feet and look nicer than typical manufactured pole perches. She spends most of her in-cage time on one of these two perches. She likes to chew on them and rub against them after bathing in her water dish. lol",3
These perches are exactly what I was expecting. I got a variety of shapes. They are perfect for my finches flight cage. They would be suitable for smaller parrots too.,3
Great parrot (cockatoo) toy!  Is holding up better than I thought it would.  She enjoys the corrugated cardboard wraps and the little plastic animals.  Will probably buy again.,3
"Greengo enjoys it. Notice I said enjoys not loves. He plays with it here and there but not one of his favorites.  As soon as I put it in his cage he was attracted to its many colors and immediately went to investigate. This toy is larger that expected. Since Eclectus don't have a very strong beak, I expect this to last a couple of months. If you have a heavy chewer or a large parrot like a macaw, i think it won't last months. Maybe the plastic animal shapes will, but the cardboard part will get chewed up pretty fast. But my Greengo is not a big chewer so he will get long use out of it.",3
"My blue front loves this toy.  When I purchase a toy for him I look for two things: how sturdy it is and are there fun things to chew. This toy is perfect.  It has carboard, colorful plastic and knots to untie.  This toy is actually standing up to his chewing.  Some toys I have bought only lasted a week.  This one has lasted several weeks and still has life in it.  I would definately purchase this toy again.  I think if is a good value for the money.",3
My Macaw  blue & gold loved it. But it only lasted one week. Better to buy toys with more wood . Thick wood . She loved the cardboard part of it though .,3
"My Baby loves these! and so do I.  I ordered 2, one came straight, the other had one main branch with three offshoots. They attach easily and are so easy on his feet. They are strong and he loves jumping from one to another.  This was a wonderful buy, and I will be back as long as you sell these on Amazon!",3
"I love it, Jake the Yellow-naped Amazon is currently unimpressed but I suspect he'll get over it. (Birds, tho. lol) It's the perfect thickness for him, so here's hoping he accepts this horrible-no-good-terrifying intruder soon. lol",3
"Not as pictured, end of the branch, bunch of small braches sticking out all over, none level, hard to place in cage so they can use it. On the plus side, one of them likes to chew on it so there is that but I really wanted a perch for the smaller bird.",3
"""Little Ricky"" (who looks just like the bird in the photo)  approves.  :D",3
"I have large macaws.  These are very durable and stand up to their ""abuse"".  However, I am dismayed that the description is not quite accurate.  The three that I just received are not even 14"" long.  The description reads 14"" to 16"".  The diameter is also just 2"" at the base and less towards the ends.  The description reads 2"" to 3 1/2"".  How does one get a 16"" long 3"" wide perch?",3
This held up well to my Macaw. I am very happy with the quality and price. I will buy this again.,3
My goffin cockatoo loves this toy. It is still holding up after a few weeks of chewing. I will definitely be replacing it when he gets it all torn apart!  Great beak occupier.,3
"I purchased this perch in medium for our new green cheek conure, not realizing quite how thick it would be. The caique they show in the picture is a bit of a larger bird with a little bigger feet, so I should have realized the size. However, I still put it in his new cage and figure that if anything, he could chew on it. He actually loves it! He's on it more than any other spot or perch in the cage, and while it's too thick for his little feet to wrap around, he enjoys running around on it and picking at the wood. He actually sleeps on it most nights. If the description for this is correct, it's made in American and made of Bottlebrush wood, which is safe for birds. The fact that it's from Florida makes me feel much better about it. It didn't have an odd smell and was perfectly clean right out of the bag, though I did still rinse it off and let it air dry before putting it in with him. We've only had it for about a week but it still looks great, even with him picking pieces off it constantly. For the price, which is pretty reasonable, this is a really great natural wood perch and I would recommend.",3
My parakeets and finches love it! I put it in the cage and they went crazy I could see a difference right away. Recommend this product.,3
I loved it! My macaw would not touch it.... we will keep trying though! Thank you!,3
A well made product which provides my birds a different surface to walk on and chew,3
"I should have paid closer attention to the description because these are a lot bigger than I thought they were going to be.  I was originally not going to use them because of the size, but they ended up working well as ""outside the cage"" perches for my canary when she has some time to fly around.  She seems to like chewing on them a fair bit and the cage clamp part feels well attached and sturdy (not that she weighs enough to cause a problem).",3
good perch my Macaw uses it often one of his fav in his cage thinking of getting another for outside his cage to stand on since he is out most of the time and all the time when I am home,3
Just what the bird wanted. Chews on it also. Good for the beak,3
The product is whats shown in the last picture but still really liked the perch. Although next time i want to know what my item actually looks like,3
"This perch is much better than expected. I love the color, texture, and many branches.",3
"Awesome value, nice shape and size. I will buy again once it becomes available.",3
My yellow-nape LOVES these perches! Very happy with them and will buy again! Excellent,3
Well made perch which attaches easily and securely to the cage. Shipment was fast and item well packaged.  Liked the perch so much I ordered two more.,3
Bought for squirrels that love this and have not chewed it up. Made well.,3
This is my Green Cheek Conure's favorite perch ever since she was a baby. It is the perfect size and texture for her to sleep on.,3
"Our green-cheek conure used to sleep in a teepee perch, but since we added this perch he prefers this one. It's a great size.",3
This dose not work with a large Macaw cage. (Due to the spacing of the bars.),3
"Ordered 2 and they were like two totally different things and too long for my large cage, don't look like the picture",3
Fits my green cheek conure perfect! She loves chewing and sitting on them all day.,3
"Gumdrop the parakeet enjoys this perch at least as much as her Booda.  She really enjoys chewing little strips of wood off it.  It seems softer than most perches, and so easy on the feet.  Recommended.",3
"My Sun Conure likes it. She can also chew on it as if it was a normal wooden branch without any issues. However, the textured material / coating does come off as a result but it's no big deal.",3
"I bought 2 of these perches, they are the right width for my cockatiel and the length is perfect also.",3
Very nice quality perch.  It was slightly bigger in diameter than what I expected.,3
"FIRST REVIEW (update below): The perch I was sent had a VERY VERY VERY sharp obvious spot where another part of it had been broken off.  Will not put it in with my birds.... may see if someone can clip and file it down, although it is quite a hard wood (might splinter).  Not worth returning, but I feel this item was either VERY poor quality control..... or someone ""got rid of"" a perch no one else would buy. UPDATE - changed rating from 1 star to 4:  Contacted company through Amazon.  Was told ""Amazon shipped it.""  Company sent me out another.  Put it in with finches and they love it.  It is light, has grooves for little feet/nails and is smooth and comfy.  Good product once I got a good one.  Thank you to Bird's Love.  Product would be a 5 star if not for getting a really bad one first.",3
"My cockatiel loves this perch!  She is the most avid chewer that I've ever had in such a small package, so this perch is the ideal solution for her.  She has a manzanita perch in her ""condo"" that just frustrates her, since the wood is so hard she cannot break any of it off.  This perch is very hardy, but the nifty little pieces of wood that she can break off just makes her day (and it's not terribly messy, so it makes mine, too).  I don't think that I'll have to replace this one any time soon, and feel good about highly recommending it to other bird owners that want to keep their birds from getting bored (note: I don't mean to make this sound like a toy replacement, but since most birds have a relatively short attention span, they need a lot of different stimulation to avoid boredom).  You will not be disappointed if you purchase this for your feathered pals.",3
"These are great because they provide safe, stable footing and your birds can actually chew on them.  These are the only perches I buy.  Once your bird has one of these you won't ever use anything else!",3
"This is a great toy if you want to immediately engage your bird.  Because it has soft wood and other chewables this toy is not going to be around very long once your grey gets going on it, but that's the idea.  The bird will lose interest if a toy is too durable, which is not going to happen with this one.  Anyway, the price is right and my bird liked the toy.  RJB.",3
"I have had this in my Grey's cage for about 4 days & Ducky hasn't paid much attention to it, but I am sure he will (he has other toys he is chewing up & playing with)  When his other toy's are demolished, he will no doubt demolish this one as well.",3
My grey is kind of a scaredy-bird and doesn't like new toys.  She took to this one right away!  She destroyed all the cardboard in a few days and is working on all the little wood sticks now.  Fun toy that is giving my Grey plenty of fun chew time.,3
Finally a toy that is as it appeared in the picture.  A nice product. I continue to shop for Bella products based on my satisfaction with this one.,3
"Our cockatoo, Harley, loved this toy, and it took him more then a day to destroy it too !!!! Great price too !!!",3
"My Mexican Double Yellow Head hates change of any kind, unless it's a ride in the car. A toy has to be reduced to unrecognizable before I'll remove it from his cage.  The Fiesta is perfect. He's spent a week with his back to it ignoring it, a few more days growling at it and when I came down this morning it had chunks missing and he is stalking it. This for him means he's loving life.  The only improvement I would suggest is a bell hanging from the bottom. I attached a small copper cowbell to entice him to play.",3
"At first my bird didn't do anything with it,but he finally started chewing on the cardboard. He's not a voracious chewer but I am glad he's using the toy.",3
"This is a great toy for those frustrated and bored birds. After giving it the once over, it did not take long to show this toy who was boss and my Grey to obliterate it!",3
"My African grey loves this toy. She goes for the wood strips first, then shreds the cardboard. It has lasted two weeks so far, which is a record for her.",3
I have a very picky scary cat bird but she loves this toy.  Hope this helps.  It's fun and easy to hang.,3
This is a favorite of my CAG - he chew the cardboard first - as far as he can reach then starts on the wood - which he loves - he's a shredder big time!,3
"My TAG loves this, and it is nearly the perfect toy for her. Why 4 stars, then instead of 5? Because I have to restring it on vegetable tanned leather. It only takes her, literally, 3 seconds to snip the twine that this is strung on, thus causing the entire toy to plummet to the bottom of her cage. Really needs to be strung with leather. Other than that, great toy.",3
My parrot loves this toy.  Great to chew on the cardboard and the wood.,3
"My Cockatoo loved this and went through the little pieces of wood first in no time flat, but getting through the cardboard took a litt more time.  It was a nice toy for him to keep him occupied for a short time for one day.",3
Perfect for the chewing parrot.  He hangs on it or swings it to scratch his head,3
Only problem is my Gray ate this up in a few days. needs a stronger wood with it for continued pleasure.,3
"I loved it--it is exactly as described.  It didn't appeal to our conure, but she is pretty picky so it might just be her.",3
All birds love this and it has lasted longer than most toys,3
"My bird went after it before I even finished tieing it up. He loved it and it actually got him chewing on some of the wood, which usually doesn't do. The only problem is that he chewed on the rope holding it together and he broke fairly easily. So, looped what was still together over his pearch. He went after the string again and now it is in pieces. That made me a little sad. I'll have to use some leather to put it back together again. He does really seem to like it.",3
This is the second one we ordered - I got heshe a few other toys - my bird is a TOY HOAR!!!,3
"But my parrots ate it up, cardboard, string, the whole damn thing...in about  a day or so.  It they're happy, I'm happy.",3
Lots of chewing surfaces so it lasts longer than some toys that are easy to dismantle. My Goffin likes it quite well.,3
I bought it and then received it and he went right for it in his cage nice size for my Amazon as well. Good purchase experience.,3
"This would be a waste for a big chewer - it lasted a couple days for our Grey, who is only a moderate chewer.",3
"A great toy for the big chewers.  Very sturdy and lasts well. Would buy again for sure!  As all parrot owners know we buy toys to eventually throw them out after they are destroyed but this one lasted well and our parrot has had a blast chewing it, hanging on it, fighting with it, etc...  :)",3
"It's not his favorite toy but only because it is durable and he doesn't like that as much. Likes to feel like a killer lol. It holds up well, worth buying if your bird likes wood blocks.",3
"Great toy, our Grey loves it. Works even better if you drill some holes in it and push some sunflower seeds in :)",3
Our African Grey ate all the cardboard and would not bit the wood.  Maybe too big for him.,3
"My Macaw loves this toy. It lasted longer than many, two weeks which is great for her.",3
All of my big birds Enjoy this product....it will keep being a rebut if they keep making it!,3
Love this toy!  Lots of easily chewable wood with knots in between each piece of wood. This is wonderful because my TAG likes to untie knots... Usually he untied a knot at the bottom of a strand and all the wood and baubles fall to the cage bottom. he loves having so many knots to untie and perfectly sized wood slats to chew up!,3
I bought this chew toy hoping to entice my birds to chew. Well...It didn`t take long. My white capped pionus munches down daily on this toy. It is wonderful. I just bought another one and placed it with my Indian ringnecks. They went for it wholeheartedly. I highly recommend this chew toy for small to medium sized parrots. They love the size of each wood block and the many colors are brilliant and attractive to birds. I will definitely be back for more.,3
"It does the job, they can chew it, and it won't kill them. The chunky pieces slow down my parrots  Average life - 2 weeks with my Greenwing Macaw; 3months with my Blue and Gold Macaw  It's not so bad in the winter and fall - I used the sticks when starting a fire.",3
"I have an Umbrella Cockatoo who destroys toys very quickly.  However, this one is taking her quite some time.  I am very pleased!",3
Our BG Macaw did not destroy this right away.  Big chunky wood - Edit:  For some reason my BG just ended up ignoring this.  He did not want anything to do with it after the first couple days and usually destroys everything right away.  I don't know if there is a smell or something about it but he left it - I tried reintroducing it whenever I would rotate toys - no dice.  He won't chew it - everything else goes to toothpicks though.  This is a mystery - but I'm trusting his judgement - there's something there he doesn't like.,3
"It is great to find a toy that is posted as large for large parrots and IS for ""LARGE"" parrots.",3
A lot of wood should last awhile. But just a bunch of 2 by 3s cut on a angle . Very easy to make yourself with a miter saw .,3
"The quality of the items were good and they were in great shape for the price. Only one of the teeth I received was chipped. However, the issue that I had with this product is that although the picture and description indicate that this will contain a larger number of teeth, while the package that I received only contained 8 small teeth. This sucks, especially since other reviews state they received as many as 30.",3
Lots of pieces along with the teeth but the teeth that are in the bag are nice.,3
I bought this for my son and he was thrilled when he saw them.  You get a bag with a mix of shark teeth and pieces and out of the bag there were a more intact shark teeth than I expected - different shapes and sizes.  This is really cool and I plan to make my son a necklace out of one of the larger teeth.  I was hesitant initially to purchase these because of some of the reviews.  I was expecting to get a bag of bits with a couple of teeth - but what I received was mostly teeth with one or two pieces.  I'd definitely buy these again.,3
Judging by the pic when I ordered it I was getting a lot but actually received a tiny little bag with about 30 very small teeth. It was according to the specs but I wish they had placed a dime next to the teeth to show their size.,3
"a collection of very small shark's teeth <an inch in length. Most of the teeth in the bag were broken, but there were enough in the bag for the kid's science project so it worked out.",3
There are more pieces of teeth most were broken and those were only an inch long. You only get approximately 20 teeth. A few that seemed to be plaster. I'm going to a real dealer this time I don't have the time to mess with trash teeth.,3
"Once the glue dried and the bleeding stopped they are a nice fit.....yeah I'm not crazy, but these teeth are crazy awesome. I'm teeth rich, great selection. Good variety, nice quality.",3
"KIDS THOUGHT THESE ARE COOL,,,, SHARKS DID""NT!! MOST OF EM FAIRLY SMALL..",3
I received a tip while standing in line at the grocery store from other grandmothers who rave about these bounce and sit balls as a sure fire way to engage the interest of a grandchlid and tire them out so they will settle down at night and go to sleep. It works. Worth every penny. Easy to inflate. Durable,3
"Great concept for an iq toy. The inner ball has two holes one on opposite sides. So you have to cover a hole to fill the top. Then without dropping any treats if you're skilled, you need to move the number ball so that it covers up. The outside has holes all over so not only the dog is in for a skill challenge but also the owner. Often Ill fill it, think I covered the inner holes, roll the toy and everything falls out. Seems like the inner ball should have one hole.  Puppy does love it but all the goodies drop out faster than a smashed piata but if you use bigger chunks, they get stuck and need to wash you out. Bad photo. Trying to show how the holes go all the way through",3
"This sturdy ball works well, dropping kibble/ treats unpredictably, making them work at figuring it out, but is not too difficult. I thought it was a little bit spendy, but now I say it is well worth it.",3
"This is a very fun game and helps with hand eye coordination. I love it at the beach, park anywhere and having multiple sets is also great.",3
my 5 month old Golden absolutely loves this treat ball.  She rolls it around and received a reward. I have purchased 2!  great entertainment,3
"The ball works as advertised. The little treats come out as the dog rolls the ball around. My 2.5 year-old French bulldog played with it for about three minutes and hasn't touched it since. It's good quality, though.",3
"Love this ball. Better yet, pup packs it around a lot. Have to be careful on putting in treats, or they just drop through. Got them in and holes out of alignment, so pup would have to ""work at it"". She did and figured it out quickly.",3
I put it on the floor and the cats went right for it!  I guess love says it all!,3
These are great.  Very good purchase.  They arrived fully charged which was a pleasure!,3
My grandson lives this.  He is 5 and he bounces all over the house. It's built sturdy thank goodness.,3
"Our dog loves this toy, it's perfect size for her mouth to chew and squeak but small enough that she doesn't destroy it. Perfect size for up to medium sized dog.",3
"I ordered this for our 6 year old granddaughter for Christmas and she absolutely loves it!  It was easy to inflate with the included pump and the ball is made of a heavy duty material that seems like it should be very durable.  Just ordered a second one for her so she will have one at home, too!  Would definitely recommend this!",3
This is for my granddaughter whom we call Ladybug. I have not opened it and inflated it yet so I cannot comment on durability. It is cute. I will update once she tries it out.,3
I can take it or leave it but my cat loves this toy.,3
Love them....they are all over my floors as my felines love to play with them!,3
These work perfectly with my Nerf Rival guns. I got two bags so we could use them in our little office at work. They are exactly the same as the nerf brand balls and a lot cheaper. Tons of fun shooting these around the office all day. Highly recommended if you need some extra or to replace ones you've lost.,3
We bought on for each of our 7 grand kids they love them ...,3
"My six year old granddaughter loves it and it fits her pretty well. I would say this is a good size for 6 year olds! I of course don't let her play on the ground outside on it, but inside it seems to hold up well!!!!",3
Bought For My 5 Year Old Son And He Said It Was His Favorite Birthday Present.,3
"Great football. Lasted all summer. The tip started to crack by Oct but, we got so much use out of it that it was worth the amount paid for it and I bought another one. Easy to throw and catch.  One warning. If you plan on playing w/ this in the colder weather, be careful as it hurts to catch it bc of the material it's made out of. And it is a little slippery so you may think you caught it but in reality, it'll just slip/fly right through your hands.  It floats so you can play w/ this in the pool or lake w/o fear of losing it.  It's a great little football, flies far and is a lot of fun. I highly recommend this toy for young and old alike.",3
My granddaughter thinks this is great. I had bought one that was too small and she was disappointed so I was glad to see that Amazon carries these for bigger kids.,3
The bouncy balls I remember as a kid and the perfect balls to get the cats to come running to play.,3
Got 2 of these for Christmas one for a boy 8 and one for a girl 6.  The girl doesn't play with her's much cause she cannot keep her balance very well BUT the boy bounces all the time; from his bedroom to the kitchen to the living room or just while he is watching TV.  One of his favorite gifts.,3
"My daughters cats (4) loved them. My cat, not so much, but she prefers things she steals off my desk, anyway. So I would have to say they are a hit with normal cats.",3
"These are well made metal jacks with a bouncy rubber ball, the same as the ones I grew up with 60 years ago. I bought a set to exercise my arthritic fingers, but my grandchildren enjoyed them so much that I will be buying additional sets before they visit again. Inexpensive sets which have inferior balls and plastic jacks are not worth the money; these definitely good value.",3
They're jacks. I'm not sure how much the quality of jacks varies by brand but these seem identical to the ones I had as a kid in the early 1980s. I used these as a stocking stuffer for my niece and nephew. Not sure if they cared but I thought they were fun. =),3
My child bounces all over the house with a smile on her face,3
"It looks great, but I can't really see the future.... :)",3
"I did not buy this to toss with my kids, I bought it to throw for our dog.  Our Yorkie has bundles of energy and she loves to fetch.  This toy is her favorite thing!  She can follow the toy as it whistles while in the air.  So, if we are playing at night and it's getting dark she follows the sound of the toy and can usually retrieve it easily.",3
"My 14 year-old son was happy to play with this when he first got it, but he lost interest after a day.  My son was also somewhat disappointed that the ""howling"" sound the toy produces is fairly faint.  I had incorrectly assumed that all Nerf products are relatively soft, and this toy would be appropriate for indoor play.  However, it is not soft, and it really needs to be played with outdoors.",3
Didn't howl as much as expected. Somewhat disappointing watching the young ones playing with it and trying so hard to get a good howl.,3
"Gave these as a gift, Mom loved the packaging and jacks.",3
Love these jacks brings back lovely childhood memories. Now my grandchildren can experience the same childhood memories.,3
"A friend recommended this for baseball practice, to improve throwing mechanics.  My son had never thrown a football before, and this one is nice because you can use the whistle to gauge how well you are throwing a spiral.",3
Purchased as a gift for a beach camping trip for adults and it was a hit,3
"It was a gift for my granddaughter. Right size for a six year old, she wanted the jumbo, I thought it would be too big for her small hands. These are perfect! Old school(Retro) I bought her two sets.",3
"I can only say that my Great niece & Great Nephew loved all of the Rokenbok toys! Since they are out in Oregon, I can only listen to my Nephew & Niece.",3
This was a gift. For a boy. A nerf. Shocked? Love it. Loved it. Want one.,3
Just like when I was a child. Extremely happy to see my grandkids enjoy them.,3
I bought one of these many years ago for my infant daughter and she loved it.  This one was for my grandson and it was love at first sight.,3
"these are great i'm using them for my craft's, they are awesome  :)",3
My boys LOVE Plants vs. Zombies!  These toys are the real deal and not the cheap knock-offs.,3
"These foam balls are excellent. They are about the size of a softball. They are sculpted foam so the facial features of each turtle is done in a 3D relief. They are made to look like the turtles on the new CGI show that airs on NICK. The outside of the balls are very shiny and thick which I think really helps to keep them from getting torn up like regular foam balls. They are great for younger kids since they don""t hurt if you get whacked with one. Overall these are a great deal considering that you get four of them and they are such a nice size.",3
"Bought this for a trip to the beach.  It held up well and is very sturdy and the whistling is fun.  That said, the front in is very hard plastic-very un nerd-like.  I can catch it, but my kids just let it hit the ground.  This diminishes the fun.",3
"Seems like such a simple toy, but everytime kids came over to our house they loved the nerf football and wanted to takei t home with them. We finallly just purchased a few to give to these kids to have at their house, and it's always a popular toy and they always want us to throw with them when we're around.",3
"Great to play with at the beach. Got lots of comments on the whistle ... I don't know how you could miss the whistle if you have ears that work. I may have to buy a replacement. Perfect, simple gift for Christmas. Note to self ... Buy one for 6 year old nephew!",3
"My daughter is 6 months old so she can't really do much with the ball yet but she loves to hold it and look at the adorable pictures. The ball is soft and I like that it's big so she can play with it when she's older too. My daughter also loves the ""chime""-like jingle it makes when rolled. The color contrasts are pleasing to the eye as are the pictures on it and grab the attention of little ones. I highly recommend this ball.",3
"I used to play with this type of football with my dad all the time as a kid. I loved how far it would fly and the way the whistle sounded as it went; it was always my goal to make it whistle as much as it did when my dad threw it! So, if you are planning on using this in a conventional way (with humans), it's great fun and I highly recommend it.  I also recommend it for dogs! My dog (lab/corgi mix) will give up on tennis balls after a throw or two, but she LOVES this dang football. She would chase it until she died...it must be something about the whistle that keeps her attention! I have purchased probably 4 of these over the past few years for use with my dog. For how often we use it, and considering I'm using it with a dog, I would say that they're pretty durable. My dog is very good and does not try to tear it apart, so that increases its longevity. We do not use it every day, so I would say that one of these footballs lasts me a couple of months. If you use it with a dog, you just have to be careful that if one of the whistles starts to peel, you take it off so it does not get accidentally ingested.  This football is so much fun- for humans and dogs alike! Highly recommended!!!",3
"This hopper works as good as they are expected to, and I bought it at  half the price of a big name brand. I also bought the Gymnic so I can offer a good comparison. This is good but just not as hard and bouncy as the Gymnic. It works though.. for little kids it is not going to matter so much.",3
Very effective for breaking HUGE chunks off mini pig hooves (I get a lot of rescue with inches of overgrowth). Need two hands to wield and anyother person to hold the hoof in place. I recommend a shorter pair if single handed trimming is desired.,3
"Professional Quality. Man, & Falabella horse approved! Great Price too!  We absolutely DO recommend these! And we hope our review is Helpful!",3
"I don't see how anyone has a problem using these nippers. Unless your hand strength is weak or your horses hooves are really dry. The drier hooves are on any animal, makes it harder to nip them, no matter how sharp the nippers. I can use these nippers one handed without a problem! Love em and plan to get plenty more soon.",3
This will probably be the only hoof clipper you ever need buy!  I can't imagine anything breaking or damaging it.,3
"These are sharp but hard to pull open. They don't fall open so two hands are needed to get them open around the hoof. I like the ones I got from Jeffers better, they fall open so can be closed easily with one hand. These are well made, just not easy to use as a woman",3
Top quality nippers at a low price.  I am very pleased with these nippers.,3
"I thought this was too heavy and unwieldy for my use on my pot bellied pig.  I think it would take at least 2 people to use this, and even then I'm not sure I could do it.  I had to return it.  The product itself seems quite solid though.",3
Used this on a couple horses to just do a little bit of trimming before snow and frozen ground came.. Works AMAZINGLY on horses and cuts nice and smoothly,3
"This thing weighs a ton, and is very hard to squeeze shut while holding a goats hoof between the nippers.  I'm sure it would work better on a horse, but it's not worth a darn to me.",3
Nice and sharp. Great balance and easy to use.  But it is what is to be expected from Diamond tools.,3
These nippers work great.  I finally gave up on my 10 year old nippers and replaced with these.  I am satisfied with the price and reliability.,3
Tkhe fur babies eat them so I guess they are acceptable,3
"Decent option.  Had to turn down the sensitivity for the shock, as it did really scare our 15lb Minpin.  I think she learned quickly, though!",3
"Great combinations of treats.  My cat is partial to seafood, so I thought I would try these.  She absolutely loves them.  I have gotten her to do little tricks to get them.  She will sit up and meow.  She will jump up on her dresser and lay down.  She will sit and say please",3
"I got this for my 2yr old Parsons Terrier, she would bark at everything that went on outside when our door is open. The packaging is really nice. The info phamplet is very clear in its instructions on how to use the no bark collar. I love that it has 3 types of correction. I wasn't to sure about the shock type feature. I was thinking it was gonna be like a taser, LOL! It is NOT! It gives a jolt like white static electricity. My husband tried all 7 settings. I was only brave enough to try up to setting 3, LoL! But it was not harmful at all. We didn't even need to turn that on! We used the vibrate with the beep and with in 5 different times barking, she stopped. She has barked once or twice not wearing the collar when the door was open but as soon as I show her the collar she stops! Another thing I really liked was that you can adjust all the settings, you can set how sensitive you want the collar to be to the barking, how strong you want the vibration or the shock. Or shut the shock feature off totally. It charges with in an hour with the usb cable and my dog wore it for a week strait so far and I didn't need to re-charge it. So Im not sure how long it lasts on one charge, but I think a week is a long time! The collar is small enough to fit a toy breed and can expand large enough to fit an xl breed dog. Their customer service is awesome too!!",3
"This has by far been the best dog bark collar yet.. We had the older model which was great. This model now features a rechargeable battery, static shock.. which i don't use... and a sensitive rating.. Very excited about the upgraded as i am in the business of training puppies.. well done.",3
Works great for runs. I love that you can make it various lengths and it has a ton of attachments. The quality is great and holds up against my puppy who loves to chew.,3
"I have had several bark collars in the past (dog barks at everything and Anything, which gets the other dog barking). In the past they are quick to break, don't work, or use batteries fast. I searched and searched Amazon for something different then what I've used in the past. SO glad she told me about this one! Although I was disappointed it came uncharged, I just plugged it into the charger and was good the next day. I had bought 2 different ones this time for comparisons (because i really couldn't decide and figured I've got 2 dogs, if 1 worked and not the other atleast I'd only have to replace one). This one is by far my favorite, I love that I can adjust it, recharge it and not buys a bunch of special batteries all the time, it's a good quality collar, and really works for my dog (which says a lot). It's so good I'm half tempted to buy a couple and send it to my neighbors barking dogs too lol honestly, at this point I really have no complaints, once charged it's been so much quieter around here then my dogs nonstop barking. I don't have any problem with my dog alerting me if we were in a trespassing type situation, but to bark at every bug in the sky, at her tail, bark just to bark all the time, it does nothing except drive me and everyone in the surrounding area completely crazy. Thank you for selling me a great product at a great price that actually works! I wanted to get a pic how sleek it looks on my dog but she never stops moving long enough",3
Excellent quality.  It is awesome to walk my big dogs with. I have full control .  I really like the hand grip. That is great when I need them closer.  Very happy with this leash.,3
"I love to run and have a standard poodle who runs with me.  It is hard to hold the leash when I run, but now I don't have to.  This thing is perfect and I can run naturally and he can come along with me.  Highly recommend!",3
Even though they loved them they were too expensive for a second purchase.,3
"Love it!  Just like with parenting...we need 2 hands sometimes while keeping our loved ones safe.  I just got a puppy 5 days ago and already used it outside to get the recycling and garbage to the curb.  Not for leash walking training as too tempting to bite/chew when it dangles.  But eventually, that will be great as well.",3
"This leash is really good. It has nice thick bungie type material. It has 2 handles for flexible lead distance.  The belt holds the doggie bags and makes the leash handsfree. This leash is a handsfree and ment to be around your waist. It has fit up to a 42"" waist.  Waking my dog is easy, it gives her room to explore but not too much room. It can stretch but my puppy isn't strong enough yet to do that. I didn't have any issues as I walked and used my phone.",3
"I love my new hands free dog leash, I wish I would have purchased it sooner! I run with my Jack Russel mix, and actually don't use the belt since it makes it too long for my little guy. I just hook the leash part around my waist to the d-ring and its a perfect length. It keeps my dog close without having to worry about stepping on or having him to far away. It's also a little springy in case he gets too far ahead, it doesn't choke him. The best part is that it's completely hands free so I can keep track of my steps too. Highly recommend!",3
my cat loves it jumps up and down when she sees me getting her bag of goodies.,3
I have two boston terrier puppies! My bostons are 14 weeks old and have just realized they can run off quickly! This leash is fabulous! I can walk or jog with my dog attached to me and he has room to move around. The elastic give of this leash keeps your dog from jarring you and tugging at your waist. I like that you have several clips to attach the leash to giving you the freedom to walk your dog on the right or left side. We live on a farm so this leash quickly got a bit dusty but it was a breeze to rinse off in the sink with some dawn dish soap. I am potty training my dogs so keeping them on a leash close to me in the house is really helpful. The waist belt is very comfortable and adjustable and I like that the leash detaches from the belt as well. The included waste bags are helpful to have on hand as well. I would love to see an addition leash available to add to the waste belt so I can attach both my puppies to the same belt.,3
"This is GREAT quality. Seriously I love this thing. My dog isn't used to it, and I don't use it to job but I anticipate it being helpful in situations where we're walking a lot and I need my hands free (whenever that might be). I tried it out and the only thing is, I wish there were like, a way to adjust the length. My dog gets a little too far away from me, I'll need to hold the leash to keep it from getting under her belly or her getting too far. I'm REALLY Happy with the quality and ease of use though. VERY nice leash set.  UPDATE: Unfortunately I took my dog to the beach wearing this... and a little sand got into the leash buckle, where it attaches to her collar. Now I cannot use it. Any idea how to get the sand out?!",3
Works great even with my big dogs! Waste strap can be used with any collar or harness which is great to satisfy a diversity of dogs! I liked this product because it enabled we to jog with my pup hands free.,3
"I have three very large golden retrievers. Their favorite word is ""walk."" It is really difficult to walk all three at the same time. I cannot walk with two leashes in one hand, so I thought that I would try this hands-free dog leash. This is a really nice leash and it came with an added bonus of 15 bags and bag dispenser. I like the black and blue colors of this leash and it is really well made. When it is fully extended, it is 63."" My dogs are very large dogs and when they pull, it's almost too much to handle. This leash is padded and helps with pulling. It is fully adjustable and very easy to adjust. It has a nice bungee for shock absorption and it claims to absorb shock for dogs up to 150 pounds. My biggest one is 100 pounds and it works very nicely with her! She's usually the one that I have to drag along because she's so far behind, but my middle dog is a puller and it works for him too. This also includes reflective stitching which is perfect for late night walking. This leash is great for my three large golden retrievers. It makes walking/running with them a lot easier.  I hope that this review is helpful to you! .",3
I have a dog leash similar to this and use it for our hyper puppy... it's great for keeping him in tow without him pulling my arm off!  My niece has used ours several times and loved it (she's 9 and wants to be a vet when she grows up).  I ordered this leash to give my niece for her birthday.  It's high quality and she'll love the cute blue accents.  It also comes with a doggie bag holder that already has a roll of doggie bags in it.  I'm super excited to gift this to my niece - she's going to be THRILLED (and I'm excited to have such an easy gift that she'll legitimately love).,3
"I really love this leash! I got it for my dog Lexie because, she tends to get out of her collar this a way to control her that is easier for me. The straps were easy to adjust by the length I wanted to be able to walk her. I have no complaints this is the best bang for your buck!",3
Huge hit with all my cats. They're a bit smaller than other Temptation varieties.,3
"My boys love plush toys, These have lasted several wash and dry cycles. Worth the money.",3
Excellent product. The material is durable and it is the perfect size for my Honda CRV; the cover protects the passenger seats as well as the backs of the front seats. Quite pleased that it doesn't shift and appears to make my Dane feel secure.,3
Katy The Cat loves them and that's what counts.  As soon as I open the package she comes running- well maybe more like sauntering - to get her goodies.  I continually buy these because she thinks they're great!,3
My favorite planner.  This is the second year I have used this brand and as long as it is available.,3
It was an old calendar and the quality was Extremely poor. It is unusable.,3
"This calendar is perfect for my needs, a family calendar with plenty of space to write on each day and take notes on the side, without all the individual day pages making it heavy. This is very easy to carry around and is very attractive. There are notes pages in the back and a small slot on the back cover to keep receipts, notes, invites or whatever.",3
Lovely heavy card stock.  Makes a nice impression.  Heavy envelopes also.  CroninCards makes very nice designs.  I have used their cards in the past and always receive compliments.  Recommended.,3
I like this planner but I really liked the one I found last year better but this is the correct size I was looking for and I like the way the months are displayed.,3
"This is heavy duty.. it worked great on cloth seats.. on leather it is very slippery,I have to put some fabric under it to keep it from slipping. I don't use the part that connects to the front head rests. Doing so may alleviate the slipperiness. There are velcroed slots that can be used to pull a seatbelt through. All in all it is good quality and does the job.",3
Have been using this cord to attach my sound bar to my Tv and haven't had an issues. Works great!,3
I don't know about anyone else but when you have a car and not an SUV it's very difficult to attach the bottom to anything on the underneath of your seat unless you have an older car. The newer Vehicles have nothing to hook the basic car covers on. This is assume just hook them to your head rests and Wella all set to go. I also notice that other people state that their dogs still get in the front with this particular hammock cover. Hello it's soft fabric I would suggest a gate that you can buy so they can't get into the front seat.  Overall great product.,3
"I've got an 08 Hylander, so I was a little concerned about the size of the cover.  After measuring my back seat multiple times, I concluded that the cover would fit, but it would be tight.  Turns out it's about 4 inches short, about 2 inches on each side.  Not the end of the world, I can live with a couple of inches of seat uncovered.  Cause my dog isn't going to hit those exposed inches on either side of the cover.  My dog is 120lbs of Shepherd/Mix, that sheds like it's his job, so I need something that will be able to handle his size and weight.  This cover is sturdy and well made.  I've no concerns about it bolding up for a long while.  The stitching along the straps that hold it up are reinforced.  The clasps that hold the cover up, are solid and once adjusted, do not slip.  The bottom that goes over the seat, has this lining that holds it in place and doesn't let the cover slide all over the seat.  It also has Velcro openings for the seat belts or a strap if you want to add one.  First day using it we got some freezing rain,  The cover absorbed all my wet and soggy pooch could give it and more.",3
"Finally, a planner that has enough room to write in, no more tiny writing that I can't decipher after the fact. The best planner by far.",3
I buy a new one every year. Always look forward to the new designs.,3
"very nice, pocket great, band to hold it together.  Everything I needed.",3
It's a bit large for my purposes - but otherwise it's great.,3
Really cute and really the only monthly planner on the market.,3
"Love it.  It fits in all my bags and at home it stays right by my chair.  Love, love, love it",3
"Perfect for my needs. I only like to use monthly view calendars with squares big enough to write a few notes on the days. I always have a hard time finding a simple, no frills calendar book with just monthly views without the daily or weekly calendar included. Most are ""pocketbook"" size and I find them to be too small. Love the extra note pages, the elastic to band the book closed, and the little pocket in the back cover. Unlike another reviewer mentioned, the dates in my calendar are all correct.  A great product!",3
Repeat customer on anything Blue Buffalo for the fur babies.  They love these - even one of mine with a finicky stomach.,3
"Love it, love it, love it!!!!!!!!!!  This was exactly what I was looking for and it arrived a week sooner than expected.  Will definitely buy another one next year.",3
"My cats didn't really like this food, but they are picky eaters.",3
"My calendars are an essential part of my life as I've gotten older. And, they allow writing on the date and notes on other pages. It's great for keeping my doctors appointments and other scheduled activities!",3
"After using the Erin Condren calendar for years, I thought I would try something new. I am so glad I did! I absolutely love this! It's layout, pullover cord closure, and extra pages were exactly what I needed. Perfect in every way.",3
"Love the look of the calendar, but the dates are incorrect by 1 day from March 2017-on.  Useless item and waste of my money.",3
It fit myT3i perfectly. It was a much more secure fit than the original Canon which resulted in the loss and need for this replacement. No problems.,3
"Not sue why but my fur baby will not eat these, she pushes it away with her nose when ever I try and give her one.",3
"Super product. For planner people like me it's tough to find all the aspects I want and don't want. I want decent monthly planner. That's all. No daily or weekly pages. Don't need em. It's really well made and contrary to other review not flimsy IMO. If I had to complain wish there were more color options- wish there were more note areas- wish it was a cooler format, like wider. Anyway, love it! I had another Orange Circle product last year and loved it to but it was too big and too many pages. Then I found this option and it is Just Right. Bam.",3
"I wish that I wasn't the first one reviewing this. First let me say that this might be a great product for your needs, but it's not for mine. Usually I LOVE Orange Circle products and I was looking for an extended 2017 monthly planner with note pages and a folder for all my loose papers I end up with by the end of the day. FIRST this wasn't a big deal to me but would be a HUGE DEAL to someone else... there are no week per page views as stated in the description!!!! As for me... my biggest peeve and the reason I have to return this is it says it comes with a ""handy"" pocket. Handy it most certainly isn't. I'd be lucky to fit 2 pages in it folded in half, plus everything you try to put in it gets snagged on the back layer of the pocket since it's essentially just a tight folder pocket glued to the back page (If it expanded maybe i'd have kept it, but I think they were trying to keep it slim-lined and rendered it useless for me). Also considering the large size compared to the thinness and the fact that they say it'd be great in a purse etc. I was surprised at how flimsy it felt and could imagine it would get pretty beat up over the course of 17 months. Other than that I think it's gorgeous and love the skinny tear-out note pages and that the calendar is large enough to write multiple things without having to miniaturize your writing.",3
My dog enjoys these. Sometimes I crumble a small amount on his food as a special treat.,3
"We were using Zukes training treats, which are easier to use, but my puppy is more eager to please when Chicken Sizzlers are the reward.",3
"I purchased this for a senior Australian Cattle Dog (aka ACD aka blue heeler aka red heeler) and used one container and part of a second before starting him on a better quality dry kibble that contained most of the ingredients. He was a rescue dog of unknown age, and already had considerable arthritis in his spine, so it would likely have helped him more if he'd been getting it for a couple more years, but it certainly didn't hurt him, and I think did help some.",3
"I truly do like the ""at-a""glance"" style planners, but this one just falls short of the mark for me. I'd prefer a plastic cover instead of the coated cardstock. I also would like a bit more room to write in the spaces. While this is sufficient, it's not high quality. The best feature to me is the band that hold it shut. They should ALL have this neat little feature!",3
The optical audio that came with my Astro A50s broke and I was left without audio on my Xbox One! after a few minutes on Amazon this had been ordered and was on the way almost immediately! This cable is cheap and works great!,3
"My red heeler loves these treats! I bought them originally because they're free from corn, wheat and soy, no artificial colors and preservatives, and no by-product meal, and I'll buy them again. They smell like bacon, look like bacon strips, but the dog's not talking as to what they taste like. I also like that I can break up a strip into thirds then into smaller pieces instead of having her glomming down on one large strip and it's then gone.",3
My pup loves these but honestly I expected these to be more like actual bacon. Instead they look and smell just like Beggin' Strips. Ingredients are supposed to be better so I'm hoping their claim is legitimate this time.,3
All my dogs love this and it is good for them.,3
"My dog absolutely loved these treats. The second he caught a whiff of the smokey scent, he came running over and licked his lips. When he tried one, he immediately wanted more. The treats are soft and easy to break into smaller pieces. They have a rather strong smell, but this was a pro as my dog was excited about it. My dog can be a picky eater, but these are still his favorite treats.",3
"My Miss Millie loves, loves loves this brand/flavor treat. And I love it because it is made in the USA - Free of fillers : Natural recipe is free from corn, wheat and soy, artificial colors and preservatives and chicken and poultry by-product meal. Win - Win.",3
My little terrier is very finicky about her kibble. I've had her over two years and it's been two years of her disappointment with my various (expensive) offerings.  A complete different story with this dog food!  Every time I'm about to fill her bowl she jumps off the ground in anticipation. Like high off the ground!  I reckon that deserves a review.  She's never been anywhere near this enthusiastic before.,3
The cats almost like them too much - they are begging for them constantly!,3
"This planner is very thin, which is just what I wanted. Also, the cover is really nice material and higher quality overall than I'd expected. I hope I can find this again next year because it's perfect for what I need!",3
I just wish we could still get these! Our dog is allergic to chicken so we can't change to the other varieties.,3
A favorite for our pups.  Can't go wrong with blue buffalo.,3
I have tried several for my aged dog- this seems to work the best!,3
"This Peacock is beautifully made and absolutely stunning. I bought it for a child, but I was tempted to keep it for myself!",3
Great colors and the little one we bought it for loves it she is crazy about peacocks and loves this one to.,3
"I got these the other day for our dog. We have a pittie/ boxer mix, about 45 pounds. He loves his treats. I love that fact that the ingredients in these treats offer a pretty small list of items, and are better items than most treats out there. Pitties hav e alot of skin problems from allergies apparently, so when we get generic or cheap treats with bad items in them, he breaks out in rashes. I'm happy to say that these pass the test and he's just as happy today as yesterday and had no reaction.  The fact that this is an add on item and came fairly cheap is that much better.  When I opened the bag, I was happy with what I saw. These treats look great (they look like little pieces of bacon) for the dog, heck, even for a human, ha ha. Of course when he heard the bag, my dog came running. My dog doesn't really drool at all, but after having him do a few tricks for me, he actually had a drop of saliva drop on my hand as he was waiting ever so patiently. In fact, he actually wanted it so bad that he stole a second treat from me before I could get him to do anything else.  He loves these treats, and I love seeing my dog happy. I'd highly recommend these, especially for the price..",3
"I buy Blue Buffalo dry dog food and training treats for my two dogs regularly and I was satisfied with this product. These treats smelled just like the cheaper brands, but are much healthier. I wish I could say they tasted the same, but I would have to leave that to my dogs: they ate them up. My littlest one would go nuts when I grabbed the bag off of the shelf. My only disappointment: there weren't that many strips inside.",3
"I was looking for a different flavor than party mix.  I figured the cats needed a change.  However, not all of my cats like these flavors.  So, back to party mix I go.",3
My chi just loves these. She prefers that I break them up into smaller pieces as she can't quite manage to eat them whole. Great treats and she is very picky. Very.,3
"These new year's cards are adorable. originally I thought the glue didn't hold, but the yellow strip on top has to be removed and then they hold tight. The company was kind enough to respond after I mentioned that in my first review. in fact, their products are all high quality.",3
"My girlfriend purchase the much more expensive Beach Body 21 Day Fix version of this portion control kit.  I will tell you how they are the same and how they are different.  The Beach Body kit and this kit as far as the containers go are nearly identical.  I am 99% sure that they are even made by the same company as the manufacturing marks on the bottom are identical as is the packaging (containers only).  The only difference between the two is that the Beach Body version has colored containers and lids, this one has colored lids with a clear container.  This kit also has a little healthy packers label on each container.  The size of the containers is also the same.  The items that come with the two kits are as different as night and day.  With the beach body 21 day kit you get videos and a recipe book.  These may be useful, but I am not sure it is worth the extra money.  This kit (healthy packers) says you can visit their website for a personal meal plan and recipes.  I think this is all you need to make this meal plan work.  The idea is simple.  You figure out your calorie level.  You then compare your calorie level to a chart that tells you how many of each color container you can have in a day.  For instance I can have 7 green containers (vegetables), five blue (fruit), six orange (protein), five yellow (carbs), one purple (fats), one dark orange (seeds) and seven grays (oils).  By the way, everyone can only have one purple which is fats.  They even have a list of each type of food and what foods are best to eat within that food category.  I don't know if I could stick to this list of foods and hope it is just a recommendation.  I think with the help of their website you could achieve the same thing you would with the 21 day fix.  I see no reason to spring the cash for the name brand product.  I received this product at a discount in exchange for my honest review.",3
"My daughter ""needed"" a stuffed peacock for Xmas.  How could I say no?  Had no idea I'd actually be able to find one, nonetheless find one as nice and appealing as this one.  She loves it",3
Great calendar with lots of space for appointments or notes. Each Month has a Tab so you can easily navigate to your month of choice. It also has an Elastic Separator (for lack of better term) that you can use for the current month so when you open it up it opens to the current month right away.,3
"This product surpassed my expectations quite abit, I would highly recommend this item to all enthusiasts and tell them this is a VERY good dollar value and was delivered on time in the CHRISTmas season. Wow ! What a wonderful retail experience.",3
Give it several days and your cuticles WILL get better. I had some cuticles on my thumbs that were rough and uncomfortable. This product after about 5 days made them look and feel much better.,3
"I LOVE this Gund Peacock! It's beautiful and very well-made. I ordered more than one, but the others arrived with spots of blue dye on the beak, so I sent them back and alerted the Seller(s). Examine yours very carefully for this defect when it arrives.",3
"My 10 month old loves this dragon. It's soft, squishy, and doesn't shed. He's a happy baby!",3
"This is a nice 12 month planner from At-A-Glance which gives you monthly appointment reminders.  I have always liked to be able to see the entire month instead of just a week at a time.  My electronic calendar holds more information so I just use this as a easy reminder to carry with me.  Most of us have smart phones that also track our appointments.  If you like portable hard copy calendars, this is one of the best!",3
"This is a pretty nice planner, however I wish it were more durable. If you are hard on a planner, this may be a bit too flimsy for you.  I do like the feel of the front and back cover. It is a matte black with a soft texture that feel sort of leathery or rubbery. It looks modern and clean (it's looks are it's best attribute for me). The months are tabbed and easy to turn to. It has a flat bungee cord closure.  I think it's ""OK"", and three stars correspond to that.",3
"First, The cover of this planner almost feels leather-like which I really like. It measures approximately 8"" by 11"". There are  index tabs for each month and plenty of room to jot down your appointments, birthdays, and anything else you may need to jot down. There's an extra place that is like graft paper for side notes or whatever you'd like to use it for. This planner is large but thin. If you wanted to, you could probably punch holes in it and stick it in a binder. I will probably end up putting this in a binder just because I think it would easily get bent up if it isn't in some type of protective case. It's thinner than my monthly wall calendar. It would do well if you tend to carry a briefcase. Other than that, I don't see this planner as one that can be carried around in your purse or backpack. .",3
This planner is perfect for us to keep track of when our bills are due and what dates payments have been scheduled for.  Plenty of room in each box to actually write.,3
Cat pushes himself into bowl with treats before I even have them in the dish.,3
"I just LOVE At-a-glance planners!  They're so well made and durable, and the design is always so pretty, especially this one.  It has a very chic, simple and elegant look.  The cover is very nice, and it's durable, and it feels like it'll hold up extremely well through the coming year.  The inside has everything you need, from your calendar, to notes and contacts and other basic information.  It's so easy to utilize and fashionably functional, I think if you're looking for a good planner, you can't go wrong with this one, or any of the at-a-glance planner.  I've had several in the past, and I'm ALWAYS happy with them.  Plus, I think these make excellent gifts for the coming year!  Overall, I'd highly recommend this product.  I just love it, and I plan to purchase at-a-glance planners in the future for gifts and for myself.  No complaints, and I'm very happy with it!",3
"This isn't a bad planner. It's a good size, it has everything you need in a calendar and monthly planner. The problem is the cover. It's made of some kind of rubber and when I took it out of the packaging, the smell was really strong. I admit that I'm more sensitive to smells than most and that most people might not find the smell of it offensive. I also didn't love the feel of the outside. I don't like the rubbery feel of it.",3
"This is a great slim planner for 2016.  Unlike many other planners, this one is thin but still has the perfect layout to include everything you need.  The monthly ""at-a-glace"" pages give you a great way to view your schedule over the short term to really avoid conflicts.  And also included are standard time zone maps and holiday pages.  The cover is thin black cardboard, but it is coated in something to make it slightly more durable and spill resistant.  And it's got a really functional band to both keep it closed or to use as a place holder.  CONCLUSION  I have tried several 2016 planners and this one is my favorite so far, even more so than several with fancy bindings.  This one is the most compact and functional for a full page planner.  So this product is definitely worthy of consideration.",3
"This is a fantastic basic, streamlined month-at-a-time planner.  We received this free to try from the Amazon Vine program and we use this for our family calendar.  The boxes are perfectly sized to fit all the kids activities (and ours) in.  The format is clean and crisp and makes it easy to focus on what the most important events for the month are.  I have no complaints.  This is a great product.",3
"The fine folks at ""At-A-Glance"" have been churning out all manner of daily/weekly/monthly planners for as long as most of us have been alive, I would think.  Whatever your manner of planning ahead might be, they've got you covered.  And they're still going strong, it seems, despite the rise in ""there's an app for that"" thinking.  I like to look at one month at a time, and this planner gives me exactly that: One month spread across two 8x10 pages, with room for additional notes.  The pages are a bit thin (not the best when you like to use a pencil and erase a lot), and there are a lot more pages than you might think for a ""12 month planner"".  That's because they've given you a 13th month (Jan. '17) just for yuks, as well as the rest of the next year spread out over another couple of pages, plus many more blank pages for ""Contacts"" and ""Notes"", additional pages with when each holiday will be for the next 3 years or so, and other odds-and-ends.  An attached flexible strap can be used to hold the book together as you begin, presumably, to stuff it full of additional scraps of paper (?), and the whole thing is protected by a fancy-stock black cover, with embossed lettering.  It remains to be seen, of course, how well this thing will withstand the treatment I'm capable of giving my planners through the year!  If you are looking for a monthly planner for 2016, you could do much worse than this one from the At-A-Glance folks.",3
"I like this monthly planner. It's pretty simple. Each two page spread is a single month. There is a good size margin in the inside of the calendar so none of the days are too close to the spine. There is a strip to the right of the calendar for notes. Major holidays are listed. Depending on how the days fall, there may be one or two split boxes for days that don't fit. The calendar is tabbed to help you quickly turn to the right month. It also has January 2017, a single page calendar reference which has the dates and days for 2015-2017, a section for future planning, a two page spread for contacts, a 10 page notes section with 5 pages of lines and 5 pages of graph, a single page events calendar, a 2016-2019 holiday list, and a time zone and area code page. For the future planning section you have 1/3 a page a month for all of 2017--a little mini calendar and then lined pages to write appointments or notes down for that month.  The cover is thicker cover stock. The elastic strip that holds it closed is strongly held to rivets in the back. The pages aren't thick, but of the right thickness.  I have no complaints for the quality, but I might suggest that you order it with other stuff. They stuck mine in a bubble mailer and it arrived somewhat crushed being stuffed into my mailbox.  In the end, it's a nice calendar planner. It's not for someone who needs to put daily appointments, but fine for those who just need to mark down some calendar dates. I like my phone calendar, but it's so hard to see a whole month! I'll be keeping this with me as way to keep track of bigger projects.",3
"I like the healthy stuff in it, as far as taste, I don't know,lol, can't go by my dog, he will eat anything if I add a little people food!",3
"This is just what I need to get reorganized. I used to have a smaller, but thicker At A Glance Weekly Planner years ago and was much more organized, but since the digital calenders came on, I just have not done well with them (not to mention that my iCal decides to erase my events completely)! I love how slim the planner is, but has lots of pages for contacts, notes, etc.",3
"The At-A-Glance 2016 Weekly and Monthly Planner was just the thing I needed to keep track of doctor's appointments, social dates and meetings of my local civics group. The planner has a full monthly calendar for each month spread over two pages, followed by spacious entry pages week by week (with room for notes). The generous writing space is so large, the planner can double as a journal, or be used just for that purpose. The back of the book has space for contacts and events, plus a list of holidays and even a time zone map of the US. Altogether well planned and executed, I ordered more for friends whose lives are as busy as mine. Highly recommended.",3
"Slim, light and to the point.  It has a 2016 calendar with the ability to take notes daily as well as notes in the corner and in the back.  Writing space is pretty large.  It is decent and good for someone that needs to have access to a minimal amount of daily notes.  If you need something more you will probably need a bigger notebook.  It is less then 1/4 inch deep or 1/2 cm.  My only issue was how it was mailed.  It came rolled up.",3
"Sometimes I feel like the only person who still uses a planner rather than some app on my phone to keep track of appointments, activities, and events.  I work at home and use a planner to keep track of the tasks I need to do for each client on a daily basis.  This planner works well for me.  Each month is spread across two pages with enough room on each individual date to add more than one notation. The advantage to this is being able to see the entire month at once, a feature that helps me prioritize my work.  The size of the spaces allows me to write in personal appointments, kids' practices and game, and other reminders. Tabs along the side let you quickly turn to a specific month as needed.  Additional features such as a 3 year reference, future planning pages, space to list contacts, room for notes, space to list events by month, and a list of dates when holidays fall through 2019.  The planner is quite thin in spite of these additions to the calendar.  An elastic band holds the planner closed.  The cover has a nice feel to it, very smooth and a little soft.  While it doesn't have the sturdiest construction, it does seem able to hold up to one year of use just fine.",3
"This planner is as basic as it gets.  The binding is kind of thin and I doubt it makes it through the year.  The paper that contains the calender is not of the highest quality and I would expect ""bleed through"" if you are using a felt tip pen.  At a glance is a perfect name for this for you will not be taking any heavy notes as the format of this planner really only holds enough room on each date for a few words.  In a word, Meh.",3
"The cover is nice and soft but the bungee cord that is used to keep the calendar closed also causes the pages to slightly curve :( Inside is a page with a 3 yr reference of montly calendars (the past, present and future year). Each tabbed month has nice size daily squares on which to write appointments. There are a few too many holidays listed for me (includes not only American holidays but also Canadian and Mexican). I do so wish the daily squares had lines. There are superfluous pages at the end (future planning, contacts and notes) as well as a list of holidays for the current year and the next three.",3
"This is an excellent, no-nonsense planner for those who need to keep track of important occasions and dates (some of them on the same day), with room to spare.  It also includes important dates and holidays, eight pages for notes, and several for planning and other events.  What I like best about this planner is that there is enough room to write several important occasions and/or appointments in each box due to one month taking up two pages, and each page is a generous 8.5"" X 11"".  The tabs and bungee cord make it easy to pick up where you left off, or go where you want to be.  ACCO hits a home run with this informative, no-frills ""At-A-Glance"" 2016 monthly planner, for those who need lots of room to write.  Last, but not least, is that the simple black ""leatherette"" look (and feel), is always in style.",3
"This is a nice, bound AT A GLANCE calendar.  Unlike the more traditional brand calendars, this is far thinner and doesn't use the wire bound binding.  Thus, this is a softbound version, and is much thinner.  As to planning, this is really meant for cursory appointments and the like.  It is not meant for an extensive appointment calendar for each day from morning to night.  Knowing that, for planning for cursory appointment details you could do far worse.  This has the expected dates through Feb 2017, and some planning areas and note taking areas.  If this is something you use to jot down dates in a briefcase or similar, I wouldn't expect the binding to last and remain pristine, it is black, but I could see by the end of the year, it could get dog-eared and scuffed.  If you understand the cursory nature, the nice-looking appearance and the ease of being able to take this anywhere, this is by all means  really nice calendar that can become used and you won't care too much by the end of the year.",3
"This At-a-Glance 2016 Monthly Planner is OK, but not great. The planner cover is a thin coated cardstock, and bends very easily. Will such a flimsy cover used on a daily basis, will the Planner make it through a year? I'm not so sure. Each month is done in an open 2 page format, and allows for a fair amount of space for each day, but these pages are also of a lesser quality paper, and if you bear down with an ink pen or write with a Sharpie, the writing is going to be seen on the next month's page. The ""Contact"" area is very no-frills - simple lined boxes to write names and addresses. Overall, I'm just not that impressed with this product. It's not terrible, but it's definitely not a high quality product.",3
"This is pretty much your average month-at-a-glance planner, but it has the added benefit of a sleek, slim, and sturdy matte covering. I'm also digging the closure band. A three-year calendar and holiday list are handy, as are the month thumb-tabs, and there are plenty of pages for notes and contacts. I'm pleased with it.",3
"This is handy if you need something that is light and can slip in the pocket of your laptop case. It's a little thinner than I expected. It's just a month-at-a-glance calendar with a few extras. Those extras include a place for notes in the back and also room for contacts. There is a small section called future planning which leaves room for a paragraph for each month. I do like the layout of the calendar pages. The boxes are nice and roomy and there is graph paper in the margins for writing some notes. I like the elastic that wraps around to keep it closed in my tote bag. The black matte cover does show smudges a lot. It's a yardstick that feels like suede a little.  I do wish that it would have been shipped in a cardboard mailer. It was in a padded manilla envelope and it got bent in shipping. This left the pages a little rippled, and being a perfectionist, I don't like it. Of course, this isn't really the product's fault, but the flimsiness of the covers lends itself to damage in shipping.",3
"I buy this monthly planner annually for my elderly mom that likes to write her appointments down rather than put them on a computer or phone.  The bungee cord has a good amount of tension that keeps the planner closed.  The boxes for each of the 30/31 days are approximately 2x2 inches - which is a nice size for writing while giving the user the whole month to view on a centerfold (two pages).  All in all, very pleased with this planner.",3
"These are better painted and a bit larger than I was expecting, which works greatly in their favor! I can't wait to use these in my vacation photos in Hawaii!! =D",3
Great product.  Fast shipping.  Great value.  My dog is not crazy about this new formula.  Don't know if it is the taste or smell.  Wish they would go back to the old formula.  Still works great.  Thank you.,3
My cats love it and the company decided not to make it any more so was happy to find this,3
too bad it's no longer available at a decent price....I paid $50 and some change for the last bag .....my dog really loves,3
I have an older dog and I was please to review the ingredients were just what I would put together to feed him.,3
"I got this for my nephew. He adores the purple zombie and it is a ""carry everywhere"" toy. Shipping took awhile but that was to be expected.",3
"Reading reviews, I'm sure this functions fine.  I purchased after reading on other sites, that this would be a good replacement for the Fluval Spec V pump, but it doesn't fit in the pump's slot, soooo....I wound up replacing with a Fluval Spec pump, and just holding onto this as an emergency backup.",3
"I love Jellycat stuffed animals.  They're all very well made and a great size for little arms.  The material is super soft and the designs are awesome, I really love dragons so this one was a no-brainer (for my daughter).  His horn and spike tail are also very soft!",3
My dogs have been eating this mixed with their regular food for 3 weeks.  They like it as much as any dry food I have offered and it is grain free.  As these dogs are seniors I am cautious about what I feed their sensitive tummies. The high protein content has not been a problem. The food does have a funky smell that I find disagreeable (-1*) but my daughter says it does not bother her.,3
"For containing such high quality ingredients - I was disappointed that this lamb food also includes chicken.  Often clients come to us with itchy dogs and we suggest that they try a different protein in the pet's diet.  Usually the pet is on either a beef or chicken diet and we suggest changing to something else.  If a client made the attempt to switch to lamb and purchased this food, clearly it would not work since the proteins are mixed.  Now if you have no allergy issues and for some reason need your dog on a high protein diet, then this would work.  Neither of my dogs requires a high protein diet, and neither of them really enjoyed this food.  I won't be purchasing this food for them unless for some reason we suddenly need a high protein diet, and there isn't a better alternative.  I do think that at it's current price point, you are spending a bit much for a lamb/chicken food.",3
I lost my original eyecup because the clip broke and it fell off the camera without me realizing it. Then I found this in Amazon and was surpised that the price was very reasonable (except with shipping). It fits perfectly like the original and now I sometime forget that this one is a replacement.,3
"High-protein and grain-free dog food that doesn't contain artificial, chemical, or otherwise controversial ingredients. It's a super high quality dog food. My dog went for it with gusto, though I know there are dog owners out there whose pets are a bit picky about food they're unfamiliar with. My dog has literally never been hesitant to dive right into any food presented to her, and this was no exception. But I felt confident that she was getting a healthy meal here - we almost always serve grain-free as a rule (and absolutely always corn-, soy-, and wheat-free foods).  The only thing that was a personal hang up for me is the use of lamb. I don't understand why anyone would choose lamb for their animal as a protein source over beef, chicken, or a fish protein source. Maybe if it was mutton I wouldn't feel bad about it, but I don't use lamb (or veal, for that matter) in my own personal life and I don't generally use it for my pet. But that's not a knock on Nutro, I would just get a different flavor if I was getting their product again (which I wouldn't hesitate to do). Yes, it's pricey - but so is all high quality, grain-free dog food. Nutro is priced in line with competitors.",3
"My parrot destroyed the original eyepiece that came with the camera (at least she left the camera body and lens alone!)  This eyepiece fits very loosely, and fell off twice while wearing my camera around my neck (at least I noticed).  Would definately not buy again.",3
"Our dog had absolutely no issue digging right into this food.  To be fair, she also eats out of the bathroom garbage pail, but I feel like she really liked this food.  We've had a few issues in the past with itchy skin or stomach issues when we've used ""cheap"" brands from the supermarket.  This bag was gone quickly and only it's price may keep this from being the go-to choice.  Our current compromise is a good quality item like this blended with a ""medium priced"" brand to have a good value/nutrition solution.  She seems happy and has no ill-effects, so we're all good!",3
"I can't do the Nutro dog food justice in a written review.  We have several dogs and go through a lot of dog food.  We've tried probably every brand you can think of, from low end bargain brand to really high end niche brands.  This stuff isn't cheap by any stretch. In spite of the price (it's not that it's overly expensive, it's just pricey and we have several dogs so go through a ton of dog food), this has become the only brand we'll now buy.  Like I said, we've swapped out brands constantly. With three full time family members and a consistent pack of foster pups, trying to strike a balance between price and what the dogs like is rough.  They say you get what you pay for, but you can pay twice this much for some of the stuff at the vets office and yah, supposedly it's best for your dogs but it's hard to tell.  So over time, we started trying mixing the expensive stuff with the cheaper stuff. We've tried going to all moist food before. We've tried using canned food only (much much too expensive).  All this experimenting caused some problems - after the dogs started getting the canned dog food mixed in with the dry food, they got to be picky eaters. So picky that they would turn their noses up when we didn't mix in canned dog food.  After not giving them canned food mixed with the dry for a few days, they'd get used to it and start eating the dry normally. However we got the first bag from Vines for free.  It just so happened that we ran out of canned dog food two days after this arrived and we gave them the really expensive **** mountain food we had.  They would turn up their noses and only come back when they were really hungry. On day 3 of that, we ran out and just used this.  They immediately scarfed it all down (no exaggeration).  We actually had a small problem with two of them trying to eat the other's food they liked it so much.  We held off buying canned food b/c it seemed this would suffice. And sure enough, they were just as enthusiastic about it each day.  After a week when we ran out, we had yet to reorder the Nutro so moved back to the **** mountain and unless it was mixed with canned food, they had the same 'meh' response to it.  The new bag arrived, we swapped it out and viola', no more picky eaters.  It's really hard to tell in terms of energy level and the like what effect the food is having but there's no reason to think there's any downside to it. The vet hadn't heard of it when we first asked but the owners of the doggy hotel had and said owners reported similar results.  I won't get into unnecessary detail but in terms of digestion, there aren't any problems that we've encountered we have in the past.  In the end, it's a little costlier than low end dog food but our dogs absolutely love this stuff. Moreover, it ends up being cheaper b/c we don't need to mix in any canned food or anything else.  They love this stuff so much we jokingly call it puppy crack.  Anecdotal evidence isn't pretty weak and our sample size isn't huge, but 7 of our dogs have shown absolutely consistent love for this stuff.  It's pricey, but IMHO, it's worth every penny.",3
"This is a terrific dog food.  My Shih Tzu loves it!  I like the fact that it is grain free and has plenty of protein.  She must go for the Lamb flavor because this food is gone as soon as it hits the bowl.  Nutro is a good company.  I have used some of their other products.  I think you can trust their products to be high quality.  My little dog is very picky, so if she hates it, I end up throwing it out.  She loves this brand.  If you spoil your dog, this is a good brand for you.  Our dog is like family, so I am extremely particular about what I feed her.  I would highly recommend this dog food.",3
Our Cavalier King Charles Spaniels really enjoyed this dog food. This is quality dog food made with high quality ingredients. Recommended.,3
"A good, healthy dry dog food.  I like Nutro's products and feel good about feeding them to our dog, their treats are also good.  Our dog is fussy, but he likes anything Nutro I've given him so far.  I recommend it.",3
"The second ingredient is chicken meal.  Which would be ok they were more honest about that on packaging.  This looks like it would be lamb without chicken, a must for some sensitive dogs.  You only realize there is chicken in it if you look at the ingredients.  And, since it is the second ingredient, one must deduce that there must be a significant amount of chicken meal.",3
The dogs favorite treat. When we have lunch he is ready for this treat.,3
"Our dog loved this.  To be honest, she is not a picky eater, so it is unusual when she doesn't just dive in and eat.  I like that the product is grain free and has more protein.  She likes it because it tastes good.  Win, win.",3
"My dog is a picky eater and she seems to like this dog food. It has a milder smell and more pleasant to me that is not as pungent as her regular grain-free food from Natural Balance. The circular kibbles are small and of a nice size for my small dog to eat. The first two listed ingredients are lamb and chicken meal, followed by chickpeas and split peas, which appear to be the good source of the 32% high protein content. Furthermore, I like that it has no grain, corn or wheat fillers, which don't fill her up are just gonna make her poop more.  I transitioned her into her new food over a couple of days by slowly and increasingly replacing her old kibbles with the new ones. She doesn't seem to have a digestive problem with the new food. So far so good. This food claims to have a lower glycemic content but I haven't noticed anything different in my dog. So I'm not sure how it works out benefit wise.  All in all, this dog food seems like a quality product. I like that it's grain free, wheat free and corn free, and contains a high protein content from meat and peas. It also smells good to me, and apparently to my dog too considering the way she gobbles it up. I wouldn't hesitate to buy it again.",3
"The first ingredient in this dog food is lamb.  (Real lamb according to the package.)  This is not one of the limited ingredient foods.  There are a lot of ingredients.  The second ingredient is chicken meal and then chickpeas.  Most of the ingredients are recognizable like alfalfa, potatoes, and sunflower oil.  It has a lot of vitamins and that probably accounts for a lot of the ingredients.  These are a kind of a small kibble.  My dogs all weigh about 80 pounds, so it was slightly small for them but they didn't mind.  Only one of the bowls was eaten right away, by our german shepherd.  The other two were left for morning.  Both of our border collies did not eat at their usual time.  I didn't take this as a food protest though; they probably just weren't hungry.",3
"We love the Nutro High Protein and Grain Free dog food as we do not feed our girl anything that uses corn as well as trying to avoid wheat as much as possible. We do use dog foods with rice some of the time, but the recipe for this food uses chickpeas, which is a great alternative! Isabelle loved the taste  and had no issues with the food digestively as well. Nutro's pet foods are a bit more expensive than many of the healthy alternatives, but we believe it is well worth the price.",3
My dog loved it and that's a huge endorsement since he likes only homemade food.,3
"Our very persnickety dog likes this food and ate it without prompting.  Did not notice any other changes in her behavior, coat, etc.  Am giving this four stars because the cost is very prohibitive, especially when I'm unemployed.  :(",3
"Chewy seemed indifferent to this brand. He would sniff the bowl and then sort of pick at it but not really eat until he was really hungry, which of course meant instead of eating his food he would beg at the table for what we were eating instead. Nothing inherently wrong with the dog food insofar as ingredients. I like the fact that it is grain free and the rest of the ingredients are for the most part ""normal"" food items and not just strings of chemical compounds. He just didn't seem to be real interested in eating it. Maybe it just didn't smell tasty to him.",3
"I am very pleased with this high protein dog food - and the dog likes it too!  Seriously, there are quite a few dog foods on the market now that have picked up on the fact that people are tired of feeding their dogs chicken feathers while the companies that make it pass those chicken feathers off as ""protein"".  Nutro has consistently been a reliable and trustworthy company.  Way back in the 1980's I worked part-time in a pet supply store and Nutro was the premiere dog food because they had a better product. While other dog food companies could truthfully boast that they were not putting ""trash"" in the dry dog food, Nutro was really making a difference.  With the High Protein Grain Free Lamb dry food they've apparently managed to hit the high mark as far as my dog is concerned. I've been buying Nutro for years, but this food gets gobbled up quickly.  I'm sure part of it is that it is new - that always helps - but dogs are carnivores (and omnivores more recently), so they really like meaty dog food.  The price is quite reasonable for this food and I will be buying it for my dog.",3
"Wow, I'm glad this stuff worked out. I tried the other Nutro salmon stuff on my friend's dog and he went into full-on Gandhi mode not even eating for days on end. When I put this stuff down, however, the little fluff ball ate it up like there was no tomorrow. Maybe it was the all protein, no grain aspect. Maybe it was the smaller kibble size, which is more appropriate for the smaller dog. Or maybe it was that it doesn't taste like old fish. I don't know and I'm back in the dog's good graces with this stuff.",3
"My aged Yorkie eats Nutro's Grain Free Lamb without problem.  Since experiencing severe skin issues last year, I've switched him to grain free products and his skin has cleared up.  Nutro's version doesn't smell or look as appetizing to me as the product I've been buying at PetSmart, but I'm not the one eating it! Since trying this product, there's been no occurrance of skin issues, though my dog's weight has crept up a bit and I've had to cut back a bit on the amount.  The ingredients seem to be sound nutirion.  Nutro's products are expensive, but if your dog has skin allergies, you may want to go grain free.  It's less expensive than vet bills!",3
"Our dog suffers really bad allergies and while the source is not readily identifiable, we've been doing our utmost in trying to give him some relief.  One source has been a tea tree oil shampoo (made for dogs) which drastically has reduced his itching every time we give him a bath.  We thought that perhaps his dog food might be another culprit.  I was drawn to the fact that this was a grain free dog food and figured ""what the heck.""  He seems to like it just fine and although he still itches, I can report that it's not as bad as it used to be...he no longer itches to the point of breaking skin.  Whether this is directly attributable to the dog food or not, I can't say with 100% certainty, but I won't be returning to the regular dog food anytime soon as long as this keeps up.",3
"My dogs had no problems with this food and appear to like it.  I like that it is grain free and low glycemic.  I also like that it has 32% protein.  I also like that the bag is easy to pour and resealable.  Nutro dry dog foods tend to average 4 to 5 stars with Dog Food Advisor and I am impressed by that.  What I am not so impressed with is the price.  The current listed price for the 4 pound bag is $18.98, which makes this dog food about $4.75 per pound.  That is just too expensive for me with multiple dogs.",3
"I got this food for my English Springer Spaniel.  He always provides a litmus test for dog foods.  He has severe food allergies and gets bad reactions to (almost) any food that is not grain-free.  Even some grain-free choices have caused rashes and itching.  So far he has done very well on this food.  He also likes the taste and shows other signs of good health (although it's admittedly hard to tell much difference after one small bag).  I always stop on over to DogFoodAdvisor and see what they have to say.  This food scores pretty high, a rare 4.5 stars out of 5, putting it up there with the most expensive grain-free foods (obviously where it belongs!).  The main ingredient is lamb, followed by other high-protein ingredients.  There are very few ""bad"" ingredients.  The only real downside to this dog food is that it costs a lot.  $67 for a mere 24 pounds puts it among the most expensive dog food I have ever fed to my dogs.  But, if you have a small pooch to feed, if your dog has special health demands, or if for any other reason this food suits your dog best, it's worth the price.  This is high quality stuff.",3
"According to the dogs who gobbled this down, it tastes mighty good.  I am happy that it is also good for them.  The price seems a little high.  You have to decide if your dog is worth it.",3
"Most dog food is a lot of marketing and hype with all of the typical formulas you see elsewhere but with higher prices.  This one actually IS better quality and I felt like it's well thought out as well.  First, the ingredients.  I knocked off a half star because they said ""no grains"" but I felt like that was a little misleading... it still has chickpeas, split peas, alfalfa meal and potatoes in it.  So yes, it doesn't have wheat or corn... but it's still veggies/filler material.  The good news, however, is that lamb and chicken meal are the first two ingredients; so the bulk of what you are getting IS not grains.  And I do think chickpeas are better than corn and soy!  It has a large list of vitamins including Omega 6 and yeast; and also has a few herbs: rosemary, green tea and spearmint.  Overall I think the quality of the ingredients is pretty darn good!  Secondly, the protein is high. REALLY high. Most ""high protein"" dog foods are in the 26% crude protein range; this one is 32%. The fat is a little higher than most too... most are about 14% and this is 18%.  So I do feel like this is much better in terms of a more natural canine diet.  So how does it pass on the taste test?  Very good!  It has small, uniform little bites... about 1/4"" wide and 1/8"" thick... good for large or small dogs.  And it was gobbled up super quick with no complaints... a definite A+ there.  It smells fine too... yay for that!  And one minor added bonus: the bag is resealable. It has a ziploc, sturdy seal to it.  Minor, I know... but it's super nice so that mice and other random animals can't easily get back into it even if they happen to get into my storage area.  And even if my dog did, the plastic bag is pretty darn sturdy and thick, so I am not sure if he would be able to really get into it.  Now another reason I took off a half star is because of the price. It's ridiculously expensive.  I can buy a 50 pound bag of junky dog food for 4 pounds of this.  I felt like it was quite overblown in price. But the quality IS nice; so if you are willing to pay for it....  I just think that for this price, chicken meal and alfalfa meal in particular have no place in it.",3
"My dog doesn't get just dry kibble in her diet, so she didn't gobble this down the first time she was presented with it. However, she does eat it and she hasn't turned away from it. She is a healthy little 11 pound terrier mix with lots of energy and no tummy issues, but I still want to feed her the best food I can possibly afford.  I liked that I could pronounce the ingredients on the label, though it did seem a lot of the ingredients were plant-based instead of meat. It didn't seem to both my little girl, though. And she is known to eat her fair share of carrots and green beans with relish, so she seems to enjoy a somewhat varied diet.  The Nutro line of pet food products seems to have a good reputation, and the product is made here in the United States. The only thing that would concern me about recommending this product to some one else is the price point. There are other products on the market that I feel are equal to this at half the price - even here at Amazon! I would suggest pet owners weigh everything and make a decision that is right for them and their fur buddy.",3
My dog loves this food and it is so good for him. DOesn't have that bad of a smell. I have been putting a little of a couple other dog foods im his bowl with this one and he always eats this one and leaves the other. He is a picky eater:},3
"A high protein, low glycemic food has a lot to offer a dog.  This food is indeed high in protein, and offers some high quality protein sources.  However, rather than grain, it has potatoes.  It also has chickpeas and split peas, which they do point out.  If you read the ingredients, you will see dried potatoes.  I don't like that they fail to mention this in the heading when they mention the peas.  Grain free is great; but there are much better options than regular potatoes.  Sweet potato would be much better.  Dr. Dodds new book Canine Nutrigenomics: The New Science of Feeding Your Dog for Optimum Health, offers great info on this topic, especially about the benefits of a low glycemic food.  So, nutrition-wise, I think this food is good but not great.  Two of my three dogs eat this readily.  One is less impressed and will sometimes pass this food up.",3
"Love these calendars!  Missed the boat this year purchasing it at Costco or Sam's Club (teach me to get sick at the end of a year); so, I was very happy to see I could find it on Amazon.

"When you order a plush toy from the Jellycat brand, you ALWAYS get what you pay for, so no price is unfair. I started collecting the bunnies a couple years ago when I came across them in the store. I thought they were the cutest things I've seen in a while and it's been a wrap ever since.  Dylan is downright adorable. His ""fur"" is not the usual smooth fur but a mixed direction to create texture (of scales, I imagine). It's still the same amount of softness you'd expect. His wings seem to be brushed cotton. The red is vibrant and actually very close to the picture. I want to say I'm surprised but honestly, I'm not. I only buy this brand of plush animals for a reason.  No, I don't know how a child would react because I purchase them for myself. :)",3
Perfect calendar for holding birthday cards and bills.  Never miss an important date.,3
"I have been buying the Avalanche ""Note Nook"" pocket calendar for myself and each member of my family for 4-5 Christmases now.  We all love the pockets in the front of each month, for storing play tickets, birthday cards for months down the road, or as I use it, for keeping shipping records for my Ebay purchases and sales.  There are so many different design themes that will appeal to anyone.  I just wish Avalanche would bring back the zen Asian motif though.",3
Great for filleting large fish.  That is what we bought it for.,3
"cats did not like these, as promised in advertising! Wasted money so I gave them to the local shelter!",3
"I buy one of these each year for my elderly parents. It is easy to read,  room to write appointments, and they love the pockets.  The only problem is that there too many pretty calendars to choose from!",3
"The product was exactly like it was advertised.  I have used the calendars with envelopes ever since I can remember, and this is one of the prettiest, sturdiest calendars I've ever had.  What's more, the shipping came immediately!  It was here for January 1, although I ordered it late!  Good service for a good product!  The attached envelopes at the bottom of each month are handy for keeping notes to myself, doctor's appointment cards, addresses or phone numbers--whatever you need to keep handy and be more efficient.",3
"Touchable softness, loveable features, and quality construction make the 13 inch Jellycat Dylan Dragon a charmer.  This raspberry-red darling  the color shown in the description is quite accurate  gives Grandma one more reason to continue purchasing Jellycat stuffed animals for her little darlings to cuddle as their lovies.   Jellycat Dylan Dragon has the ultra-soft fur that is a hallmark of Jellycat stuffed toys.  It feels wonderful to the touch and makes these animals very cuddly.  Jellycat Dylan Dragon features velvety, felt-like wings, spines and a tail-tip; although these features are not actually velvet, they are not felt.  His little black eyes peek out from underneath his fur.  Jellycat is my favorite brand of stuffed toys.  Each creature is carefully made, soft and cuddly, and very, very loveable.  Jellycat Dylan Dragon is no exception  5-stars from Grandma and her grandson!",3
My husband has been making delicious donuts using these cutters. Like that they are stainless steel.,3
"Pretty good, but the plastic window suckers do break if you pull too hard.",3
"I make my own envelopes, and this is great to use to ship my products that I make and sell from my etsy store at http://www.etsy.com/shop/Aim4Beauty  .  I sell handmade belly rings, and steampunk Necklaces. I also even ship vintage watch parts and pocket watches in these envelopes I make from this nice heavy duty paper and I sell these stuff at http://www.etsy.com/shop/Aim4Goodies.  Great to print on a normal printer too!",3
I love these calendars.  I get one every year.  And they are pretty too.  Helps me stay organized.,3
I have to give my dog treats with no corn or wheat and treats without these ingredients can sometimes be hard to find.  These soft treats are his absolute favorite and they are a good value on Amazon.,3
"These are the BEST Calendars by far, The calendar is made from Top quality paper, the dual pockets are great for bills, school papers, medical appointment paperwork. I have used them for at least 5 years now. My favorite it the Butterfly Calendar",3
Product arrived timely and in good shape. Very good quality material. Would buy this maker's items again.,3
"My youngest wnated to ge ther sister a stuffed peacock...I have no idea why. It's cute, colorful and soft.",3
"I have a small dachshund who developed an allergy to chicken.  This is one of the few treats I've been able to find without any kind of poultry meal, poultry by-product etc.  I used to be able to buy it locally, but now no one carries it.  Was really glad to find it on amazon.",3
My dogs do not like these at all. They won't even try them. Never had that response before. So now I don't know what to do with them!,3
"Works well, makes the cuticles really soft and you only need very little.  Will buy again!",3
"Since starting this product 3 weeks ago, my extremely arthritic german shepherd/collie mutt has been able to resume her favorite pastimes of counter surfing and knocking the trashcan off the table so that she may snuffle around for snacks at her leisure. Also, the other day she jumped over a foot high fence around the garden - that has been able to keep her out because I've never seen her jump in 5 years. Both of these activities are a foot above her head and require the use of her ""bad"" back legs. It's been a year of trying to find a supplement her stomach can handle, with no incidences. Well, it's back to padlocks and impenetrable safe boxes. Thanks Halo for helping my pound dog be herself again.",3
Soooo cute & squishable!  Need one for home & one at sitter's!,3
"My cat is not all that excited about this, but she eats it sometimes, and it seems to be good for her.",3
"The product I received is the black jar that is pictured. One reviewer mentioned she got a white jar instead. According to Halo's website they have changed the formula and it is in a white jar. The ingredients on this page listed under, ""important information"" lists the ingredients of the new formula only. To read the ingredients of the black jar blow up those pictures. The only side effect I have noticed is my Maltese dog's long moustache and beard turn yellow after eating this supplement sprinkled on his food. But everything else is all positive. My dog is 8 years old and it was getting more difficult to jump up on the sofa, he would get stiff a lot and have to stretch before moving and he didn't run as much and couldn't walk very fast either. Well, that has all changed. He is not only jumps on the sofa, he can jump in the car again. And he is running fast again and his stiffness has disappeared. All of these improvements happened in just 3 weeks. I hope the new formula is just as good because this one is good as gold. Very cost effective since I only had to use 1/2 tsp/day!",3
I have purchased these four times. My puppy loves them and it keeps him from chewing on everything else in the house.,3
"Works great. I've used several versions of this same model motor for a fountain, but the cats drink out of it. After a while, the motor would get clogged up. This version has clear directions that tell you how to take it apart to clean it out.",3
"I am a 42-year old woman and yes... I bought this for myself.  I cuddle him sometimes while I sleep.  If that's wrong, I don't wanna be right.  I have named him Ben and he is awesome.  He is VERY soft.  And I love that he's floppy -- the beanie things are all in his hands and feet and bottom.  So he sits just like this picture.  He is also very well made and has sturdy construction, for those of you thinking of purchasing him for a child.",3
My boys are 13 and 12 yrs old so this stuff is like a miracle worker.  They run and play like young pups without the pain they would normally have with out the expensive vet meds.,3
"This is my labs favorite treat. She is a stronger chewer, but these last surprisingly for a long time. I highly recommend these treats...",3
What else can you say.  The item arrived on time and as advertised.  The dogs love them!,3
"I like the no mess and the dogs love it, even my cat eats them.  Like that it's all natural too.",3
My poodles like them. I have ordered these several times so they are a hit in this house.,3
I've purchased this pump several times for my outdoor fountains and they give you good height for bring a small pump. Will keep buying as needed.,3
"My 3-year old dog has been eating these since she was a puppy.  She likes to unroll them, eat the meat first, then chew on the rawhide.  These treats calm her right down when she starts acting crazy....I have them on automatic re-order because we can't live without them!",3
"My dog loves them and even though they're made in China, appear to be of good quality or at least I've never had a problem with them. But here again they are made in China, which always makes me a little nervous.",3
I was sent two cutters for doughnuts with holes. Both identical with same item number. Decided to keep.,3
The only food my Ragdolls will eat......at 10 years old their coats are gorgeous and silky smooth. My cats are healthy and happy. I can no longer find Eukanuba locally so thank goodness I can order it from Amazon.,3
"It came within two days of ordering,very fast! Was packaged well,looks exactly like the picture! it's soft,tail has a posable wire in it but also has an extremely soft material making up the tail. It sits up on it's own and is perfect! I had no ordering issues and would absolutely buy from this seller again. Thanks for sending me what i was hoping it would be,a perfect stuffed peacock. :)",3
My dogs love these treats.  I have bought them many times and the quality is always consistent.  I like the fact that Nylabone makes these as it is a trusted brand.  I will continue to order these.,3
"My dogs liked them, but I am looking for a chew that lasts longer. They were gone within 5-10 minutes",3
"The flooring is hard on the dogs so when they changed the supplement I was giving them, I tried this and it is easy to use, and they are having no trouble with their feet and legs. The 7lb poodle had luxateing patelals  and had an operation on both back legs and is able to run again.  Thanks for a good product.",3
What do  I really need to say.  We plugged it in and it worked. Guess that is all there is.,3
Both my dogs love these things. Whenever I give them these I'm tempted to take a bite. they have that chewy cookie look. The packages are dated and the product is made in the US.,3
"My Ragdolls seem to like it and it keeps their hairballs to a minimum, so I am happy.  I will continue to purchase this product, perhaps in different flavors, but in this type and brand.  My breeder recommends it, my veterinarian recommends it and so do I !!!!",3
Adorable red dragon. Looks a little purple online but more of a deep red color. My 4 year old was super excited to receive this from the Easter Bunny.,3
My dogs love these biscuits. Can't get enough of them. Keeps their breath nice n teeth cleaner than even my brushing them. Great buy.,3
Made in CHINA CHINA CHINA. My dog threw up. This stuff is from China. You don't want it for your dog long term health.,3
"For such a hefty item to be shipped, amazon has an excellent price compared to local retail. This is a higher end product and my cat loves it. he has been eating it since a baby though so he doesn't really know better.  Love having it shipped to my doorstep.",3
This paper is great!  It is a good weight and the color is SUPER bright!  I will be ordering again.,3
"I traveled with my 16 lb Cavalier King Charles Spaniel.  She fit very well under the seat in front of me.  She was asleep before we left the gate, and remained comfortable throughout the flight.  The case is very easy to carry on shoulder or with handles looped over rolling bag (travel partner's carry-on).  Very sturdy construction, I expect it to last for many happy trips!",3
"The zipper works well.  My kitty fits well in it.  He is a big kitty.  He is comfortable in the bag.  When I am carrying the bag, it is comfortable.",3
"I have a few of the Jellycat stuffed animals and continue to get them just because of how much my daughter loves them. They are soft, well made, and although on the bit expensive side complete worth it because they get a lot of use from the kiddo at bedtime, tea parties, and as ""friends"" during the day. I also have the elephant and sloth and she loves them all.",3
This is the 3rd Fujifilm memory card that I've purchased from Amazon. They all work fine and have not had any problems. I expect this card to be trouble free also. Good price and  free shipping if you want it.,3
Perfect for the Fluvla Spec V.  With very few easily done modifications it fit perfectly in the overflow box.  The flow is so much better and left more than enough room for my heater.  There is of course some hum but wrapping the unit in foam deafens this considerably.  No louder than a moderate sized skimmer for those concerned.,3
Used this for biscuits and cuts wonderful.  Now I don't have to use a glass.  Biscuits came out of mold with no problems so doughnuts should do the same.,3
"I bough five beef treats and five chicken treats.  I was disappointed that all the beef treats had an expiration date(""best by"") of only 3 months away.  The chicken treats had a ""best by"" date of eight months away.  Amazon replaced the beef treats ... but unfortunately with the exact  same ""best by"" date treats; subsequently they credited me.  My dog seemed to really like the chicken treats ... he was a little fickle with the beef treats.  Admittedly my puppy (14 year old Lhaso)  is rather spoiled.  I would probably buy the chicken treats if they were nice and fresh with a LONG expiration date.  I am giving this purchase a middle of the road rating.",3
Miss Bluebird knows that sometimes you just can't make it when sending Christmas cards out and she says these are wonderful to have.,3
I took off the front and back covers with a little bit of trim work to fit inside my fluval spec V tank. Twice the flow as what came with the fluval. Love it!,3
Bought these for my dad. He made us all donuts. They seem to be good and sturdy. The donuts came out great.,3
"I love this product.  I keep it in my purchase and use it after every manicure and I rarely get hangnails.  If I don't use it after a manicure, I always get hangnails.  Not sure if that's because of the product, but I would have to think it is.",3
"He loves them. Not much else to say, he's thoroughly satisfied and so I am as well. My cat chewed into the bag though, I guess she smelled the chicken.",3
"Very high quality at a very reasonable price. Heavy duty material with a very well thought out barrel protector for the muzzle. Good protection for mounted optics, heavy zippers and generous pocket.",3
"I'm a professional chef so I'm a little choosy and snobbish about my knives.  This knife is well balanced, has a good cimeter curve, stays sharp, is easy to sharpen, and has the lifetime warranty from Kershaw. I live in Portland, OR, and free sharpening from Kershaw is the reason why many of my cooking knives and my pocket knives are Kershaw, KAI, or Shun. The blade guard that comes with it is great too and fits the curve perfectly.  This knife does a nice job when you are breaking down a big piece of meat. Its also good for chasing your mis-behaving employees around the kitchen with. (Just kidding, I use my serrated knife for that).",3
This was a gift for my 5-year old grandson.  He has carried it with him for weeks.  It's very soft.,3
"This is the only food I've found that my cats will readily eat without becoming sick. All other brands I've tried they either ignore or they vomit out shortly after eating. Unfortunately, neither Petsmart or Petco carry this brand of catfood, so I have to order it here.",3
"My son loves this one. We read a book about Dragons before bed. He likes telling us about his Dragon. He likes the wings, his tail, the color. We like that it's well made and soft. Good buy!",3
My cockapoo loves this beef treat!  It is healthy and is soft.  I add half of one to his breakfast and dinner.  He loves it!  Highly recommend.  One word of advice....I order the 5 pack of both the beef flavor and the chicken flavor.  The expiration on the 5 packs of beef is in April.  While I have until October regarding the Chicken flavor.  So make sure before ordering in bulk that you will be able to use it up before expiration date.,3
"UPDATE:  I am updating my review to alert people that it seems that this product has been discontinued, and that the closest formula to it that I've been able to find is Iams Premium Protection Adult Cat formula.  I hope this helps someone.  Iams owned the Eukanuba brand before both the Iams and Eukanuba brands were sold to P&G, and then P&G sold both the Iams and Eukanuba brands to Mars in 2014.  It seems that Mars has decided to just go with the Iams brand name for their cat foods, although the Eukanuba dog foods appear to still be available.  The cat foods are no longer listed on the Eukanuba website.  Since the same manufacturer owns both brands, hopefully the Iams brand will be just as good.  Original review:  I ordered a bag of Eukanuba Adult Cat Chicken Formula from Amazon. I used to feed the Eukanuba chicken formula and the Eukanuba lamb formula a few years ago with great results, but my local pet supply store quit carrying it. After I could no longer find Eukanuba, I switched to Iams Premium Protection for a while, but the local pet supply store stopped carrying that except in the small, expensive by weight bags, so then I switched to the Science Diet Mature Indoor formula after carefully checking the ingredients list. After Science Diet changed their formula to include cheap and nasty wheat gluten which is nothing except a cheap filler that adds no value whatsoever to the food, I am so glad I ordered the Eukanuba cat food. On Eukanuba once again after a few years, my cats' coats have become incredibly, noticeably silkier than on the other foods. My cat that is sensitive to wheat no longer has watery eyes and dirt stuck to the inner corners of her eyes due to the watering caused by wheat sensitivity, and her stools are not loose at all. Amazon has the Eukanuba chicken formula at a great price right now, and with free shipping, the price can't be beat. The best way to purchase these foods is in the largest size bags as it is less expensive by weight that way. I will keep buying Eukanuba whatever it takes to do so because it gives my cats the absolute best health.",3
"I've been looking for a chew/treat that will last my Welsh Terrier longer than 5 minutes and I came across these. I like that these aren't all rawhide and that there is a soft chicken flavored center, which my dog loves. These take him about 15-20 minutes to eat and he's always very excited when I take 1 out of the bag.",3
Our dog lives these treats and is very happy with these since she is allergic to chicken. We love the treats,3
used this for my dog to travel on airplane.  my dog loves it and sometimes just sleeps in it (my biggest fear is that he would be scared of it and never go in it).  fit perfectly under plane seat in United airplane.,3
I gave 4 stars because my dogs love these treats but they are made in China. I should have paid closer attention to the package and the missing American flag. But the dogs love them!,3
"Even though this product is NOT the traditional rawhide chew and therefore doesn't last long, I buy it because it contains  prebiotics which eliminates the need for yogurt (or other medications)mixed in dog food or treats (per vet instructions)due to my dog being on frequent antibiotics for UTI's. Great price with free shipping.  This product sells for 24.95 at Petsmart when you can find it.  The only problem I have with this product is the package seal-doesn't seal properly once this package is opened. Would like to see this product sell as save and subscribe to prevent monthly ordering.",3
My dog loves them - and that makes me happy. What else could a person ask for in a dog treat?,3
"Our dogs love these treats, and we do too as they have healthy ingredients.  We purchase them as soon as the supply goes down.",3
"My boy LOVES these!  I like to give him one as a before bedtime treat when we run through a few learning exercises.  He is very focused, as he knows he will be getting one of these at the end our our lesson.  This is one of the few treats I've found that have this consistent enjoyment on his part.  The price is very good, too, as these are considerably higher at Petsmart or Petco.  Unfortunately the bacon flavored ones are $10 higher at the moment.  I'm hoping these stay the same low price!",3
Works just fine and the holes do come out. We had no problems using it. This has said it all.,3
"great soft treat for my pup... I do this as a save and subscribe, it works out great for me and my sweet pup!",3
"Milkbone please keep making these treats, I can no longer find them in stores in our town. These are are one of the only treats I can feed my two yorkies that don't contain Chicken products. Since we removed chicken from their diet completely they no longer have allergies, ear infections, and most importantly, no more vomiting in our carpet. Our vet said that after he recommended removing chicken from most of his patients diets, he's actually lost revenue because so many of our pets are no longer sick as often.",3
excellent quality very good product and far less expensive than Staples and the quality is as good if not better than Staples,3
My standard poodle loves these and when I could no longer purchase them at my local Petsmart or in any other store in our area I turned to Amazon.  I really don't know what I will do when I can no longer find them- these are great because my dog can enjoy them without getting stomach problems. She loves them and we give her one whenever we go out to keep her busy and happy,3
My dog begs for these at night after she has her dinner...they are hard to buy in the store so found them online,3
We like Eukanuba.  We feed this brand to our dog and two cats.  I normally buy the Sensitive Stomach instead of this bag but decided to try it because it was cheaper.  My cat ended up barfing up hair balls so back to the Sensitive Stomach.  Otherwise they ate this and never complained.,3
"This was a great product and a great value.  I would recommend these, as a dog lover. they were gobbled up",3
"I recently purchased the ""Allen Dakota Gear Fit Scoped Rifle Case 48-inch Green Black"" here on Amazon for $36 and this Plano  400 series for $35.  They are both comparable in quality.  Pro's of this Plano case include: - This Plano 400 has a rubber muzzle protector sewn on, that is very good. - The pockets are all sewn into the the case in a more logical manner. - The material is reinforced on the bottom.  Short-coming: -  The zipper does not seem as sturdy as the Allen rifle case.  Both cases have average padding to protect protect your rifle.  I returned both cases and ordered two others in the $50-$55 range. I'm looking for better protection and quality without going to a hard case.",3
Got this to raise the flow level in my Fluval Spec 5 and it definitely does that! The flow is fantastic!,3
"My husband got me the one with the straw as a surprise one day to help me drink more water.  It worked.  I used it so much the paint wore off the outside.  This will keep water cold all day even in a hot car.  I couldn't find anymore at Target, thank you Amazon!!",3
"If you have a sweet, loving fluffball that metamorphoses into a feral hellcat when confined to a small space, you've just found the perfect carrier!  You know the drill: you have to trick your cat into entering the tiniest room in the home, containing both you and the dreaded carrier.  Closing the door triggers a biochemical reaction deep in your fluffy sweetheart's brain and next thing you know, a terrifying physical transformation has taken place and you're trying to corral a puffed up ball of volcanic anger and tiny whirling knives into the soft-sided rectangular prison of hellcat's worst nightmares.  If you survive this heroic endeavor, you face another challenge: how to prevent imminent escape.  Keeping the carrier in one piece is an equally important goal, of course.  Hellcats laugh in the face of most soft-sided carriers: their flimsy mesh disintegrates at a steely glance, thin nylon or canvas sides melt like butter beneath razor claws, and weak zippers part like the Red Sea if hellcat even thinks of making a break for it.  But hellcat has met her match in the Sherpa Ultimate Bag!  The only devastation my hellcat has managed to wreak on her Sherpa is in the form of a shredded fleecy mat.  This hellcat owner recommends replacing it with something more substantial, or tossing a blanket over it.  You could use a plastic carrier as transport, and I'm sure someone out there reading this is wondering that exact thing, but hellcats take even less kindly to carriers with barred doors that invite inquisitive dogs at the vet's office to inspect their mobile prison.  Hellcat wants to travel as inconspicuously as possible, and the multiple flaps act as iron curtains between their burning resentment and the world at large.  Strips of industrial-strength mesh near the top of the carrier let in plenty of oxygen, keeping hellcat's mind sharp and fresh...as sharp as the claws that will soon be shredding your tender flesh, and fresh as the blood that will soon be pouring from your wounds.  So, in other words, I highly recommend it!  I'd give it a solid 5 stars if the fleece mat was thicker and more hellcat-proof.  If hellcat has to stay in her carrier unsupervised for any length of time, I use twist ties to secure the zippers - just in case.  I've seen her do her worst to the carrier to no avail, but I don't like to take chances.  You can turn your back on hellcat, but then you'll always wonder what evil may be lurking in the shadows...  Oh, by the way, once hellcat has resumed her normal sweetie pie form, she will seek out her Sherpa for naps!!  It's just the right size for her elooongated 10 lbs. body.",3
Great little pump!  This is my third one but for other uses...  only had one quit and that was after 12 years!,3
great but this gets stuck in my pocket so often thats and its not really worth it four more words,3
"Arrived on time and in good condition.  Looks to be a good quality knife at a fraction of the cost of a forschner.  I plan to use it for filleting salmon.  I havn't gotten a chance to use it yet, so time will tell how well it holds up, but innitially I'm impressed with the finish and quality.",3
"I love these and in fact bought this waterbottle for the second time after my daughter dropped it so awkwardly that the top was broken. It is very pretty, however I with I could put this in the dishwasher without the beautiful design coming off after several washes, however, pretty much all thermoses do that. I would buy this again.",3
"My little fat maltese didn't fit into his old carrier anymore, and we went to PETCO to shop around and being the dramatic dog he has always been, he went ballistic and hopped into this one at the store and wouldn't get out and he is very obedient to me. So since he was whining I as his loving pack leader ordered it for him for half the price from here, thank you so much. I love this bag, I can choose to keep him covered or if it's cold I can block out the elements with ease and no one has a clue I'm carrying a dog, perfect!",3
My cats have been on this food for 14+ years they love it and I don't have to buy too expensive or too cheap. This is just right and keeps them healthy.,3
Purchasing meat in bulk and cutting it down requires a very sharp knife.  This Kershaw cimeter knife does is perfectly. Slices through with ease. Nice safe blade cover as well.,3
"It's sturdy and comfortable for my little 16 lb. dog. He's a size such that a smaller one seems to be too cramped for him, so this is very roomy for the guy. It's not heavy, so I can easily carry him in there. I do have decent upper body strength, though.  The material is sturdy, but that makes it bulky. I sometimes wish I would have purchased some more standard bag instead of the ultimate, but who knows.",3
"I love this leash! I have a 120 lb. rottie/shepard mix. Hes a big, strong boy and he likes to explore while on our walks, so the length is really great. I feel very secure using this heavy duty leash. I have just ordered a new one, as the one i have is about 2 years old and the spring inside which rolls the tape back up has kind of loosened up and the first foot or so of tape dosent retract anymore. But i cannot complain at all after using this for almost 2 years, almost daily. So its a great product, and i hear they are going to discontinue them. I hope not. This is the best leash ive ever owned!!!!",3
"Great quality, thick padding.  Fits a CZ 455 LUX with a large scope and rings permanently attached. Side pockets are large enough to hold magazines, paperwork, etc. Glad I decided to go with this over the 300 series. CZ 455 LUX has a 20.6"" barrel and 39"" overall length.  This fits perfectly!",3
This is the second one of these I have bought.  I take them to work with me.  I work 12 hour shifts as a nurse and it will keep my drink cold for much of those 12 hours.,3
"We took our cat on his first flight. He wasn't too thrilled, even with his calming kitty treats. However, this carrier was perfect. It fit a little tight under the middle seat on a Southwest flight, had to squish the top and sides a little. However, this wasn't too bad because the rest of the time my cat had a little extra room to stretch. The outside pocket was very practical, and the foldable flaps meant we could make sure he had enough ventilation. The strap is comfortable to carry, we didn't try the shoulder strap because of his comfort. Finally, having the option of dropping him in or through the side flap was great, specially for putting him back inside after security check.",3
"I have been buying this treat for my two 10 yr old Westies.  They just love them.  When given to them, it takes them a long time to finish it.",3
"My Siberian Husky is a VERY picky eater, but enjoys the Milk Bone Healthy Favorites Chewy Treats whether Beef or Chicken. I wish there were more in each package!!",3
"Usually Milk Bone products I don't buy but these were on sale and I thought I would try these out.  My two dogs just love these treats.  For them, these are just as good or better than higher priced items.  Because they are soft, I interchange them with harder treats so their teeth stay clean.  This is a treat I would definitely buy for them again next time I catch a sale.",3
"My dogs tend to spit out pills, so I just sprinkle this on top of their food. I have several ""oldies"", but they're still going strong. Have been feeding this product for years now.",3
"Our kitty is 9yrs old, 11lbs and about 19 inches long from nape to base of tail. She, of course, knew this was a carrier, and of course was skeptical of it. We left it out a bit for to become accustomed to it and sniff it as much as she wanted. Yesterday when we took her to the vet, she of course didn't want to get into the bag, we had been trying to get her in with treats, which worked during the week when we were trying to get her accustomed. In the end we got her in (not w/o a bit a crying from our MamiCat) and started on our journey to the vet. it was raining lightly and the bag is really good for warmth, we could see her and she could see us with the ""window Shades"" and i believe she would have been comfortable if she wasn't so nervous. We got this deal really great ($50!) and couldn't believe the value. I would have paid almost 3x that much if I would have bought this at a brick and mortar store. Great buy",3
"After being so satisfied with my green medium carrier, I purchased my 2nd Sherpa carrier in a large since one of my pup has grown so much. The red one that has flaps that can be kept down for privacy and to block the cold air on the airplane floor.  If the pup wants or needs extra ventilation and visibility, the flaps can be rolled up and hooked to a ring on the handles.  It comes with a large side pocket for carrying collapsable bowls, treats and toys.  The material is of excellent quality.  When I had both carriers, the green and red,  on the floor last night my pups jumped from one to the other.  They love them both, and I do, too.",3
"This product states for dogs, although some people report that they safely give it to their cats in small doses.  I should have done the research before ordering, but the questionable ingredient is alfalfa, apparently.  If you google this, there is some concern about cats ingesting this, although may be just in large quantities.  Probably safe, but I just don't want to risk it with my older cat.  So I'll use this up on my dog, but not the most cost effective product for glucosamine/chondroitin for dogs.  I'll order cosequin for cats, which my vet recommended in the 1st place, but I had thought the powder form would be easier than opening the capsules....",3
Heavy materials used throughout. Nice that all flaps can be opened for viewing in or out. I would buy again.,3
"The Flexi Brand Leashes are nice looking, comfortable to hold and easy to control. Our dog can smoothly move in front of and around us and the leash extends and retracts smoothly. My hands are a little weak from injuries, and I found the Flexi Giant Leash (26 foot) to be so heavy I could not comfortably use it. I use the Flexi Comfort 3 Leash (Large, not XL) which is shorter but considerably lighter.  However, the large may not meet the needs of a very large dog or one that needs ""distance"" on the leash.  This line of leashes can't be beaten!  Just be sure when you purchase the XL that you are aware it is very heavy and large.",3
"ever since eukanuba has been making cat food it's all i have fed to my kitties. from the kitten food on up i have had excellent results in terms of acceptance of the food to overall health of my cats. they utilize more of the food thus there is less waste, which is very noticable when you have 4 cats. their coats have a healthy shine and there is never a problem with dry skin. it's a bit pricier than most cat foods but, to me, it's well worth the extra money. i do mix it half and half with the hairball formula since three of the cats are strictly indoor cats.",3
"im so obsessed with this carrier. its so sturdy and has a one year warranty ! it fits my 18 pound dachshund and he absolutely loves it, along with my 7 pound dachshund. this carrier is high quality and i will be buying from the company again. more than happy with this product !",3
"My big Maine Coon cat Sean Coonery loves this food!  If you want a healthy and happy cat, I highly recommend this food.  My cat also made a video review and the video review can be found here [...].  I order this food exclusively from Amazon because of the free shipping!",3
"This is the second Sherpa bag I purchased, but the first Ultimate bag.  My Cavalier King Charles Spaniel outgrew my first Classic carrier (medium).  My only complaint with this bag is that the retaining strap used by the seat belt is on the wrong side of the bag.  When placed in the car with the strap to the rear, the air panel faces the back of the rear seat, not the front of the vehicle.  In order to use this successfully in the car, the seat belt now has to strap over the front of the bag, so my dog can have visibility and better air flow.  Sherpa products are great, but this one needs a moment of thought for a simple redesign.",3
"This is a well-made, fairly easy to use flexi-leash.  What I don't like about all flexi-leashes is that it teaches the dog to pull; therefore I won't be using it.  However, for those of you who like flexi-leashes, this is a well-made, one-button leash for large dogs.  The unit is kinda heavy, but has to be if you're walking a 100 lb. dog.  I never really got used to the button for stopping and holding the leash because I used it 3 times before putting it away.  I have trained my dogs to walk without pulling and by the third time on the flexi-leash they were all starting to pull--not good.  I will go back to carrying a 20 ft. training lead for when they want to off-road; it's not nearly as heavy and I have an easier time on recall. The 4 stars rating is because it is well-made, retracts quickly but is heavy.",3
this was a great investment. i have two dachshunds and they sleep in this bag in my room.  they love it. they have both learned how to get in it on their own and they run to my room every night and crawl in. i actually bought a second one to replace this one if it wears out. the bottom is also a leak proof nylon so if they have an accident it won't damage the carpet.,3
"4.5 stars if i could give half stars.  I was looking for a large enough bag, with as much privacy possible.  This bag has 2 side panels that you can roll up to allow more visibility, or keep down to allow minimal visibility.  It's roomy inside enough for my 17-lb french bulldog puppy.  The one complaint that i have about this bag is that the shoulder strap is not cushioned, and the rubber part should stay in the middle of the strap to provide minimal cushioning, but it slides off to the end and the strap easily slides, which creates a longer strap than i can handle( (I'm only 5'2"").  after a few seconds, the lack of cushioning on the shoulder strap really creates a burn in my shoulder when I have to lug my puppy around.",3
"...but the product is tough and effective for dogboarding. I can only hope that over time it stays strong, not like our others (cheapies) that we retired from use, not only b/c of breaking, but the potential danger of breaking and injury that very well could result from such an accident.",3
"These are great leashes for taking my big dogs for walks.  Gives them plenty of room to explore.  This is my second set.  The first ones still worked, but one was starting to show signs of difficulty on retracting.  I had the original leashes for about 5 years and used them almost every day for an hour or more each day.",3
"We have a 100 pound Akita, and love the Flexi Gian Leash.  This is the 3rd one we have purchased.  The price was the best yet, and it arrived quickly. I would highly recommend this leash to anyone with a big or strong dog.",3
I have a lab/sheppard puppy who is not even a year old and all muscle.  I bought this leash because it was recommended to me and you can't buy a heavy duty leash like this at your local pet store.  I love it and it works great.  I would recommend this leash to anyone with a large dog.,3
"I had my aging cat on this for years. She had arthritis in her legs and I KNOW it worked because once, I ran out and she stiffened up immediately. As soon as I put her back on the product she was fine. They say this product is for dogs only but it is fine for cats too, they only had to make this labeling distinction recently, I don't remember why. Make sure you dont' give them a dog-size dosage though! just a little sprinkle a day.",3
I've had this saw a month or so now and I am impressed with it.  It cuts great and the blade they send with it is very good.  I'm remodeling our house doing pretty heavy construction and this saw has taken all I've thrown at it.  I wish the front grip had some rubber on it for better hand hold but I'm adjusting.,3
"This is a great and smooth cutting saw. I love it and probably won't ever need to buy another one. The LED light is useless as others have mentioned, but I didn't expect it to be anything special. Highly recommended over other similar priced saws.",3
"I used to use American tools like Sears Craftsman and Skill Saws for 20 years. The problem is that the motors are not well made. They last well, but they start up with a jerk which is not a great thing, you have to wait a second and let them calm down to use them. If you are in the middle of a board or piece of plywood then you have to try to hold them so they don't jerk a knoch out of the board. Also they are loud and noisy. I use a head set so the noise does not effect my thinking - consentration about what I am doing. This Makita has better winding on the motor and better brushes so is purrs to life and you don't have to worry about it jerking in your hand. It is also quite. It feels balanced and is simple to cut with, of course the blade you use is everything. The aluminum housing is great too, it is a snap to line up a cut and keep it lined up through the board. But this saw or the Bosche would be my pick. I am a contractor in Florida.",3
"I would first like to mention that I received this product for review by the company.  Now on with the review. First and foremost, I appreciated that it arrived in very Eco-friendly packaging. Many electronic devices come in large, plastic containers however, this company uses small cardboard. I think many people can appreciate an environmentally conscious business.  Inside the Package: The charger, the triple port charger manual  Specs and Features: 36W worth of power, high power output at 7.2A,  5V,  3 Ports (Universal USB ports), Adjusts automatically to your devices voltage setting and adjust output accordingly, Built-in over-current, over-charge protection, device weight of 1.25oz, 4 prongs secure device in car charger instead of the usual 2 prong on most, all 3 ports are easy to see due to Blue LED lighting  This charger is really valuable for the way we use technology today. Since the average person owns at least 2 devices that are in constant use, battery drainage is a huge concern. Along with that is the cost efficiency of having emergency chargers for all these electronics. That's compounded when you add family and friends into the equation.  I can attest that after a long Thanksgiving holiday of using the Aukey, it's not only economical but a lifesaver. For example, we got lost on the way to my Uncle's house at night and our GPS was basically drained. Needless to say, it was reassuring to know that we could plug in the GPS, my Samsung Galaxy and my BF's iPhone all at once. We didn't even have to bother my mom who was busy talking on her cellphone to even notice we were lost.  Seriously, this item is a must have for multiple device families or individuals. I especially think so for females. You NEVER want to be without power for communication devices while away from home.  Last thing I'd like to mention is the ease of use and portability. Usually when a batteries dies, I'm scrambling to find the right external charger but not with this product. Just keep the Aukey in your car and you will always feel secure when commuting. It's very easy to use and I typically pop it in before hitting the road or at a red light. The fact that it's a Universal 3 port charger, is the by far the biggest selling point of this device. Very well thought out and designed charger.",3

When traveling, I'm always in need of charging something while I'm out and about or on the road for business. I have my tablet for work, my tablet for personal use, my phone, it's a lot to keep charged. The Aukey charger makes all that recharging simple.  The Aukey charger features 3 total USB charging ports, all three rather universal and offering maximum charging up to 2.4A Each! Impressive. With the Aukey charger, I am able to use all 3 ports at the same time with maximum amperage, and I haven't had a compatibility issue yet across Apple, Android or other devices.  Overall, this charger from Aukey is a truly powerful charger available at a budget charger price. It's great for anyone that needs to keep a spare in your bag for any random occasion. Just two days ago, I found the charger extremely useful in a rental car I had that did not have any USB charging ports. That made this product a true life saver.  I love that it has universal ports and offers up 2.4A on each port.  [Review Sample Provided For Evaluation And Review]",3
"I've used this in my Toyota Camry Hybrid and charged my iPhone 6 Plus and Samsung S2  at the same time.  I never encountered any errors and my phones were all charging like normal.  I like that it has a blue led when you plug it in to show that it is on.  The 3 outlet design is convenient because I can charge my phone and my wife's, plus a passenger if need be.  The charger works as advertised and fits in my car socket perfectly.  I recommend it.  Complimentary sample provided for review.",3
"These days the new vehicles come with USB ports and even HDMI ports. Our minivan fits this profile. However, the USB port is inside the glove compartment, and in the back, very convenient, right? This Aukey USB car charger is a life saver for me to say the least. I have used other chargers in the past, but nothing compare to this three Port (36w/7.2A). Before, there always seemed to be a competition in our van on which device got to use the one or the two ports charges that we own. This problem is now history.  Description: The car charger is simple and compact (3.75*1.83*1.34in / 1.98oz) design. It is not bulky. It is among the smallest and lightest USB car charger with 7.2A output that I have seen. It is compatible with Apple and Android products.  What do I like about this device? 1) It is simple and compact 2) It is user friendly and practical - it is plug and play 3) It brings peace in our minivan  when my wife and I ride together, she uses one port for her phone, I use one, and we now have an extra port for the GPS. I will soon buy another one for the kids in the back seat so they can connect their iPad, iPod, and tablet. 4) Each port emits 2.4 amps 5) It charges your device rapidly and does not over charge like the ones you get during tech conventions for free  What don't I like about this device? I have not found anything wrong with this device. It is great. It is so great that I have a feeling if I get one for the kids, they will be stuck on their electronics during long road trips. I really like this charger and I have benefited from it already.  I would strongly recommend this device for a Christmas present even part of stocking stuffers. You will not be disappointed.",3
"Something most chargers were lacking is enough ports and enough power. This solves it all. I can have 3 ports charging at one time, and all at 2+ amps. That's a faster charge for every device. I always walk around with at least a work phone and a personal phone.. So my passengers never can charge since i was using a dual port. But now with a trio of ports, that solves the problem. The device is great and allows me to use my power port in the car efficiently and effectively.  Of course, you can also charge tablets with the device since it has enough power to do so at a reasonable rate.",3
"a must have in your car, its a secure and firm slide in, does not wiggle loose or require pushing it back in. other brands i've tried seem to slip out eventually but not these and have 3 ports comes in handy. this is a second time I've bought these, one for front passengers and other goes in back for rear buddies.",3
"For the longest time, I've had the same dual-port charger since the old Motorola Razr days, that was provided to me from Verizon.  Now, I know over a decade since that phone was released, but I still had the same charger.  Having gone through multiple phones over the years, I finally got to the point where that old charger didn't charge fast enough to any of the devices my household had (iPads, iPhones, Samsung Galaxy phones, etc).  Plus because of low 0.5 amp charging capability, it didn't charge at all when I had more than 1 device connected to the charger.  Looking to Amazon, I found this charger and holy cow, it's a day & night difference.  Device charge FAST, regardless of how many I have connected.  I've tested this with an iPhone 6, Galaxy S6 Edge+, and full-size iPads.  I'm VERY pleased with this charger because nowadays, whether you're taking a long trip or a short one requires multiple devices to be charged at the same time!",3
I got this charger at a great price. It is for three cords and works really well. No need to spend a lot for a charger. Very pleased.,3
"I bought this to replace my old port; it charges relatively fast. It charges my phone up to 25% during my 15-minute commute to work. I think that's pretty good. It's clean, sleek looking. I like the blue light that indicates that it's on while charging. I would totally buy it again if it ever stops working.",3
"The review sample of this charger has quickly become my favorite. I have been using it for over six weeks thus far and aside from the technical specs the reason why I love it is the fit.  My other car chargers - some of which are as powerful as this one - all have oval shaped barrels. All jiggle in my lighter socket and sometimes a slight tug on a cable will unseat them. This one fits tightly and stays put.  Of course, the charging rate on this one is as fast as a wall charger for my Galaxy Note 3 phone. The rate does not diminish when I plug in two tablets. To be honest I have never bothered to benchmark the charging rates of the tablets, but the Note 3 and its 3300mAh battery charges at 1% per 2.5 minutes, which is the maximum charging rate for that device.  Another thing I like is this runs very cool even when all ports are populated. That is not the case with many high speed chargers that I have owned or tested.  Bottom line: there are chargers that are as technically as sophisticated and powerful as this one, but few come close to the stable, precise fit this one has on my lighter socket.",3
"If you want the best, select Droll Yankee.  My feeders and seed catches are beautiful.  The seed catch is nice and big and does the best job.  When I was filling my feeders the other day, I accidently bumped one of my feeders and knocked it off of it's high perch and on to the ground.  Oh, oh, I thought I surely would have broken the seed catch, but not a scratch was found on it.  That's some tough plastic.  Thanks Droll Yankee.",3
"The Droll Omni Seed Tray easily screws into the bottom of the Droll Yankee tube-style feeders, and collects the spilled seed.  It's great for a new feeder, too, since you can sprinkle a bit of seed in the tray to attract birds to your feeder. Cardinals prefer the added perch that the tray gives them, so I was pleased about that, too.  I found that ordering the seed tray from Amazon's sellers - even with shipping - turned out to be a better deal than my local specialty bird shop. For my second Droll Yankee feeder, tree arm, and seed tray, I did purchase the complete set from the local store as they provide a good deal of guidance for the backyard birder, as well as full repairs.",3
"Birds, especially doves, love this.  Unfortunately the squirrels do too.  If you can keep the squirrels away - get one!",3
"Actually the bird feeder looks like it would work fine IF your bird feeder has a screw bottom.  Unfortunately, I didn't read the product description very well so received it.  I just tried to return it but it says IT HAS A NO RETURN POLICY.  It may be that if your order is defective you can return - but I bought incorrectly and lose out.  Not a policy that works for me - so you'll have to be your own judge.",3
"This size is right and it's well constructed, but the tray has come off twice now. It doesn't break and I can always screw it back on, but I fear that one day the screw plug will not be found. I may replace it with something metal and use a little Loctite. I'm sure it's the squirrels hopping on it that has pulled it out. Fortunately the habanero seeds should keep them away now.",3
I purchased with a Droll finch feeder and it's high quality.  It gets a 4 star instead of 5 because it's kind of small and does not catch as many seeds as it could if a little larger.,3
Works to keep most of the seeds from falling on the lawn under the pine tree where I have it hanging.,3
Won't fit any of my Droll Yankees feeders. I threw them into the trash can.,3
I got this to go with the new generation sunflower tube feeder. It's really easy to install. I now have more birds and larger birds hanging out at my feeding station.,3
"I rated this only 3 stars because it did not fit any of my tube feeders, some which are Droll Yankees and some that are another brand.  As it turns out, the problem with the Omni seed tray, for me at least, is that it is totally flat in the center, and a standard threaded plug (one comes with it) is not long enough to reach the threads inside the base of any of my tube feeders. For the eight Omni seed trays I had bought, I had to invest another $25 ($3+ each) for longer threaded plugs, which were very difficult to find!  So, unless you have a feeder that has internal threads that come all the way down to the base edge of the feeder, this is not a tray I would suggest you buy. Instead, I would suggest any clear seed tray from Wild Birds Unlimited, which are not available on Amazon and are just a little higher priced than the Omni tray.  Before you buy a clear seed tray, I would definitely suggest you make sure it's one that will fit properly on the model of feeder you own. The only solution",3
Seems like a good idea at first....but then the rain gets to it...seeds harden.  Has to be taken down almost every week that has any rain and cleaned.  Although some birds go to the tray to get the thistle....no many....so there is much seed that lays there and just gets hardened with any moisture at all.  Will not use next year.,3
"This tray is larger than I expected, but now that I'm using it, I'm glad it's this big. I'm using it on the 20 port Thistle feeder and it catches all the seed the birds seem to knock out, and they are using it to eat up the spilled seeds.",3
Droll Yankee make exceptionally good products and the really do replace broken feeders,3
If you love feeding birds this is a must have for every feeder.  Saves on seed.,3
"It's as well made as all the Droll Yankee products are, but this just provided a seat for the squirrels in our yard.",3
I actually inverted this so that the lip faces down.  It still catches the seed and allows small birds to perch without becoming clogged.,3
"Am I glad I got this tray.  It holds as many as a dozen finches, if there's a big enough crowd on the feed tube.  Always happy to accommodate the overflow.",3
"The house finches are constant wasteful eaters of safflower seed which is expensive.  there is a huge mess below the tube feeder.  I got two of these and it catches the seed and then the birds sit on the tray and eat it so some improvement.  bad news, doves can sit on it and join in wasteful feeding",3
Nice addition to the feeder. Cardinals and doves seem to like the tray. The seed waste is reduced and no squirrels.,3
"Used in conjunction with the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Droll-Yankees-SRG-Seattle-Rain-Guard/dp/B000HHOKW0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Droll Yankees SRG Seattle Rain Guard</a>, I can use the seed tray to help select which birds I want to visit my feeders.  The Seattle Rain Guard will make it more difficult for larger birds to land on the feeder while the seed tray will make it easier for larger birds (and squirrels) to land on the feeder.  For example, I put a Seattle Rain Guard and the seed tray on a&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Droll-Yankees-CJM13GP-13in-Green-New-Generation-Metal-Peanut-Feeder/dp/B000K8C58C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Droll Yankees CJM13GP 13in Green New Generation Metal Peanut Feeder</a>.  I received a reasonable amount of traffic from nuthatches, and hairy & downy woodpeckers.  The seed tray also made it very easy for squirrels to jump 6 feet through the air and land on the peanut feeder.  As soon as I removed the seed tray and the Seattle Rain Guard, squirrel raiding stopped and I immediately started getting lots of traffic from larger woodpeckers like flickers and red-bellied woodpeckers.  I do lose a little bit of pecking waste (maybe 10%??) without the seed tray in place, but it's a small price to pay to keep squirrels off the feeder.  I appreciate the flexibility that the seed tray provides.  As long as I don't have a squirrel problem (such as on a single tube feeder presenting safflower seed), I always use the seed tray.  It cuts down significantly on the amount of wasted seed and gives desirable birds more landing space.  The trays have lots of drainage holes, but I still get waste buildup over a period of time.  It's rather easy to clean.",3
Had to replace some broken trays.  The older trays broke in a wind storm so we order a new tray.  Help to keep the seed up off the ground.,3
"Using the larger trays helps keep dropped feed off the ground and the birds eat more food without wasting it (falling on the ground).  It saves effort and time, because you don't need to weed under the feeder.",3
"The Omni tray can be attached to the bottom of the Droll Yankees feeder with a pastic threaded plug (furnished) or a wing nut (not furnished). It is a simple task to complete and no tools are needed. The tray has a a number of holes around the outer perimeter of the feeder to let water drain. Having a tray means not only preventing seed from falling to the ground but also attracting birds that are too big to use the perches. The few seeds that do fall on the ground are soon consumed by doves, if they can get to them before the squirrels arrive.  This tray is made in the USA and is a quality product from Droll Yankees. It will attract far more birds then just the feeder alone.",3
"the privacy tent is a very clever item. well made, out of good materials, but highly impractical. the privacy issue with your cat is much less an issue than being able to keep the electronic cat box clean and working properly. this tent makes it virtually impossible to see what's happened in the box, and to smooth the litter around now and then. this is something you'll need to be able to do. i bought it, but wound up lining the bottom with a blanket, and a few toys. my cats sleep and play in it.",3
Missing parts. Unusable. Not worth the money due to having high enough sides of the litter box.,3
This is poor quality.  The zipper doesn't zip and I really should have sent it back but by the time my husband put it together it was too late.  Do not recommend this product.,3
I ordered this for the littermate but the only bad part is it with cheaply made and it is at her broke,3
"The frame does not fit the tent - Had to cut the tubes down to make it fit.  Then it was an ordeal to get the blasted zipper to work.  This is definitely NOT worth the money they charge for it.  A call to 'customer service"" was a joke -- the woman who answered, after hearing the problem, transferred me to the person ""Who handles that product,"" which ended up being voice mail - so I hung up and called back, only to have the phone answered and then hung up.  LitterMaid was a great product when it first came out.  Unfortunately, Applica has cut corners until it is a barely usable item.  When this new one breaks, as I'm pretty much guaranteed it will, within the year, we'll save up and go to PetSmart and buy the competitor's version of the LitterMaid, which I heard is halfway decent.",3
"The tent functions as advertised - it hides the cat box. Yes, it's flimsy. And yes, initial construction was difficult. I even broke a pole in the process of putting it together. But a little duct tape secured the brake and it was then hidden under the canopy and out of sight. My main complaint is that it is difficult to remove the box from the tent for cleaning and is not very well ventilated (leading concentrated cat box smell). I'd rather give this a 2.5 rating, but I rounded up.",3
The canvas material is easy to keep clean.  A large cat box for mutliple cats fits in here nicely.  I have had a few cat litter box furniture pieces - but the moisture always seeps into the wood and it gets warped and stinky.  This solves that problem!,3
My husband has a knack for putting things together but we had a heck with this item.  We could barely fit the tent over the posts and zipping the top part to the bottom.  The posts are plastic so if we tried to bend them a little to fit the tent they would've snapped in half.  When we finally got it together I put our classic littermaid in it.  The opening is not very big so the litter box doesn't come in and out of the tent easily when I'm emptying the receptacle.  We have a 2 yr old cat and 2 newly adopted kittens so the littermaid gets a lot of use and so far it's done a decent job keeping litter from going everywhere..,3
I waited over a year to review this item to make a proper review.  The plastic is of that of a grill cover or patio furniture cover.  The PVC frame that came with it didn't fit properly so my husband used a saw to modify it to be assembled correctly which was disappointing.  It doesn't keep any smell inside and is simply used to avoid making eye contact with your cat while they are using it.  I threw the bottom portion away since it was too much trouble to zipper the thing on and off when I did thorough cleaning.  Not a fan,3
My cats love it and so do I. I no longer have cat litter flying out all over the floor as  any litter they fling out stays in the tent. I have 3 of these and don't think I could do without them. I believe my cats like the privacy as well.,3
"We purchased one of these tents a number of years ago and it is still going strong.  This one arrived with cracked support rods (different material than original) and the plastic is stiff and brittle.  Contacted seller about rods and they promised to send replacement.  After waiting quite some time, seller advised that their supplier was out of these and issued a credit.  Nothing wrong with the seller other than slow on the follow up - the product is just not the quality of the original models.",3
"My personal opinion is that the plastic frame tubing is horribly cheep and fragile. I am a big DIY and have a lot of finesse putting things together and 2 of the plastic pipes spit in assembly with almost no force from me. The plastic tubing doesnt hold together at all. When you try to take the plastic/vinyl cover off to change the litter half of the frame pulls off with it. You basically have to reassemble the whole thing every time you change your litter.  If you're not careful youll break more of the frame trying to zip the plastic cover over it. I have found that it is NOT worth the fight to try to zip it up at all. After 2 weeks and reassembling the thing every time I took it apart, along with more pipes breaking,  I found that it works best if you throw away most of the frame and only use the bottom frame with a few upright frame pipes and gently lay the top over that. It looks like garbage but it still keeps the initial smell down after the cat does her duty. I would not recommend this to anyone. A big cardboard box would look better and be much more functional then this thing.",3
"We finally (between my husband, my son and me) finally got this thing stretched over the plastic frame, but it tore on the seam at one of the corners.  You have to lift up the heaving litterbox to put inside of it--it won't slide in or out over the connecting rods in the bottom.  Soooooo, you can imagine how easy to clean it is--NOT!  A two piece design with the top that would fit over the box with a bottom sheet that snapped onto the top piece would be a better design.",3
"One of my cats absolutely refused to enter it, and did his ""business"" next to the litterbox instead.  The big guy flattened it, and a couple of others hated it so much they made a point of spraying it and trying to wipe their butts on it.  Needless to say, it ended up in the garbage.  It's not that these cats won't use a covered box -- they will and do -- they just really, really hated this tent.",3
"I had three kittens and they mad one hell of a mess, litter always kickied all ove rt he floor. useing this helped a lot to keep the litter where it beliongs. I still had a little out the front but only the first 6 inches or so. where before litter was in all directions. I will buy ans I would rcomend to anyone to buy this product.",3
"i got my first litter maid so long ago, i saw it advertised in a magazine and ordered it.  Must've been around 1994 or 95.  Not too long after that, i got the tent.  I went through about 3 or 4 Litter Maids in that time, the motors kept working but they got too dirty and it was time for a fresh one, was my thinking.  That one tent outlived all those litter Boxes.  For me, the tent was great, I liked that it was light weight. It wasn't too flimsy, i could always easily unzip it and zip it back.  Sorry to hear the new ones are poorer quality, i hate when that happens. I have ordered one because i am about to start using a Litter Maid again after a couple of years with a Litter Robot, and when i took the tent apart last time, when i got rid of the last Litter Maid, one piece of the frame wouldn't go back on, i don't know why. But i have to say that overall, that one tent i had certainly held up well. My cat is not rough on things so that may be part of my success with this item on my first experience.  At that time, i had recently moved into an apartment that didn't allow pets, but we already had the cat before we moved in so since she is small, quiet and an indoor cat, i thought i would try and see if i could keep her under cover. The tent was perfect. The manager rarely came into my apartment, only for rare repair incidents, and when he would come, i would drap a table cloth over the tent. At worst, if he came in unexpectedly because of an emergency, i don't remember that happening but if it had, the tent itself would not suggest that there was a cat toilet there.  the tent always did a great job of keeping the odor contained. The tent was crucial to my situation and i have good memories of it.  If i'd known they were going to start making a poorer quality tent, i would've saved the other one. It wasn't worn out. Just one piece of the frame came loose and i tried to get it to go back but it wouldn't. I abandoned it too easily probably because i was switching over to the Litter Robot at that time. At first i gave the tent 4 stars just now, but i have to change it to 5 because my tent lasted about 12 years and was still in good shape when i stopped using it, and it really helped me out by minimizing the mess and odor of a cat box, and camouflaged my catbox so that my cover was never blown. I have ordered the current model of the tent and am definitely concerned after reading the bad reviews. It sounds like maybe there is not much quality control and maybe some units are better cut than others. one can only speculate.  i have my fingers crossed.  i will update my review if the assessment changes.  10/3/10 Update A year ago when i wrote the above, i ordered a new one of these, despite bad reviews.  I wanted the litter Maid to be in a tent, so i ordered it.  It was unusable.  The cover was much too tight for the frame, and it's a really cheap zipper, the little zipper teeth don't mesh together around the whole length of the zipper.  I assembled it when i got it and since then, a year ago, it's sat unused in the spare bedroom. It was really diffcult getting it set up because the cover is too tight, but what made it unusable for me is that in order to clean the litter box i need to unzip it partially so i can pull back the tent flaps and get to the litter box.  The zipper is so flimsy and the cover so tight that extreme pressure has to be applied to open or close the zipper, unlike my old original litter maid tent which was tight enough but not a big production to unzip and re-zip. i never even thought about it.  The zipper on the new model i have is so flimsy that it would never hold up under the kind of puilling necessary to open and close it.  I just now disassembled it because i'm going to be moving back to my house and i am packing stuff up. It was really hard to unzip and the teeth of the zipper were unmeshed in places.  Very poor.  I left the 3 star rating instead of 1 star because the original version of these was so good, lasting a cat's lifetime without problems, i want to give some notice to the fact that it's a good idea with a good design and low cost compared to the fancy litter box disguises, and to the longevity and sturdiness of the original one.  But i would not recommend buying this one, although Amazon will take it back if it's defective so if anyone wants to try it out, your mileage may vary.",3
"I'd owned a tent before years ago but had to discard it due to too many connectors breaking.  It was a hideous grey/green like in the picture.  The new tent is a light tan which is much more pleasing.  It's tough to put together, which hasn't changed, because the tent is so tight on the rods.  My only real problem is that the fabric is definately thinner (read cheaper) than it used to be.  I stuck my hand in the hole for the cord and barely put any pressure on the edge and it started a rip.  I just hope my cats don't notice it and make it worse.",3
"Yes, I agree this is not the most durable tent in the world, but I don't understand the bad reviews.  My 10 lb. cat has sat on the top of it and it has held up fine.  This is a wonderful tent.  It keeps the litter inside of the tent and off my floors.  It causes the cat to go up and down the ramp instead of jumping off the side of the litter box throwing litter everywhere.  I change the liner and lift the front of the cat box up with one hand and vacuum up all the left over litter once a week.  It also is amazing for containing the odor.  According to the reviews there must be a lot of lazy people that don't like to bend over to look into the tent to see what's going on.  I think it's pretty easy to get on my knees and check it out once in a while to make sure everything is running smoothly and to add more litter.  Honestly, this cat box is made for one of the electric cat boxes, if you don't have one of those you're going to have odor regardless and yes it would be a pain to have to scoop a cat box every other day but it's not the tents fault.  This product was made for the electric cat box.  I think a person would have to be crazy to spend $30.00 on a cat tent and not spend the $90.00 on the electric cat box.  This is a tent.  It's not meant to have a cat sitting on top of it.  What do you think would happen if you threw a camping tent up in your front yard and you went and sit on the top of it.  Would you leave a bad review for the tent because the ""tent"" was flimsy and didn't hold up?  It's a tent people... What do you think you're buying? I've had mine for 2 years no zipper problems and still holding up fine.",3
"I've had LitterMaids since they first came out, and had the very first LitterMaid privacy (and litter containing) tent. That tent has finally bit the dust - the fabric had been washed so many times that it was getting holes in the fabric. So I bought a new one. What an enormous mistake. The new ones do not fit the frame in any way, shape or form. I tapped all the connections with a hammer so that they were all tight, and then tried to put the tent on the frame - there is a 1 inch gap between the top and the bottom and they can't be zippered together!!! So I tried to massage it on - moved more fabric to the front, got the zipper started - and the zipper separated. Okay, put the zipper back together and try again - the slider became deformed and would no longer fit onto the zipper pin. The metal slider itself started to come apart. What a horrible piece of unmitigated JUNK. Don't waste your money unless LitterMaid announces a major redesign of their litter tents. It's sad, the first one was flimsy but worked great and fit properly. Someone, somewhere, cut a few too many corners on this product. The whole kit and caboodle is now residing in the trash.",3

"The privacy tent does keep litter ""contained"", my siamese has a habit of ""slinging"" cat litter . The frame is plastic and one of the plastic 'tees' broke easily. had to return the first one due to zipper ""malfunction"". The zipper is difficult to zip, very tight. I had to reset the auto cat box and that entails unzipping .. after which I don't attempt to re-zip, the top just sits on top of frame.",3
"I am fairly disappointed with this after being so pleased w/the stand.  The tent is short and most cats like stand up straight to poo.  Also, the velcro already attached (not nearly enough to do anything) to the tent releases when attached to the velco pad we must attach to the stand.  Lastly the tent is to help keep the litter from spreading, which this does not do.  there are only four 1-inch patches of velcro, the rest is open for the litter to fall all around the unit.  Don't waste your $$ on this accessory.",3
"Pros: Keeps litter better contained. It falls inside the tent or right in front of the entrance, instead of all over the room. Gives the cats privacy. Keeps the smell down a bit. Cons: It's difficult to get the zipper closed. The litterbox doesn't fit out the entrance easily (and unzipping it is out of the question). It's difficult to reach inside and scoop out clumps that the littermaid rake missed (and it misses lots of clumps, so I have to deal with this problem 3-4 times a day).",3
"This is the 2nd Littermaid Tent I have owned ... my cats love it, I love it and I'll definate buy again if needed.",3
"I have been using the Cat Tent for years to cover my Littermaid Mega.  Pros:  provides coverage, privacy to the animals and offers some degree of odor control.  Does not retain odor.  Cons: Fits too tight, which causes the zipper to break and fail.  Vinyl also discolors after 6 months or so and it can pick up stains fairly easily.  COst is also a con - this thing along with all LitterMaid products is too expensive.  Overall, I have owned several of these.  Eventually, they start to look bad on the exterior and the zipper will fail.  That's really all I can say about it.",3
"Yes, in time the posts will break. This is usually because a naturally curious cat will jump on top of the tent, and the posts aren't designed to support this kind of weight. To fix this, build a replacement frame later using low cost PVC pipe and connectors that you can get at your local hardware store. After that, the tent will work great. As another reviewer mentioned, you don't have to check the litter really, just measure out a cup or so per week and sprinkle it in there. You also don't really have to unzip the tent or pull the litter box out. There's enough room to flip the lid on the littermaid and replace the container if the box is shoved all the way back (which it should be for the curtain flaps to help prevent litter kickback into the room). You will probably also want to vacuum underneath the litter box in the tent from time to time with a vaccum attachment or hand vac (again, no need to remove the box or unzip it really). The tent is also made of a plastic/vinyl material that stands up to the washing machine on gentle cycle if you ever need to rinse it out for some reason. If the posts were stronger, this would've been a perfect partner to the littermaid.",3
"The Privacy Tent is a must have IMHO.  I just ordered my fifth one.  The cats are very comfortable using them, they keep the litter mass off the floor, the litter box out of sight, and are easy to clean.  I had absolutely no difficulty putting them together - a simple matter of inserting the support poles in FIRMLY and the tent fits just fine.  My cats get on top of them sometimes, but none are broken.  I just wish they were available in colors!",3
I've used the tent for 2 years now without any issues.,3
"The tent was rather cumbersome to put together, and now that it's in place, I've found it relatively difficult to get to the litter box for maintenance (e.g., to clear a jam or add more litter).  But it does work!  It covers the litter box completely and the cats can get into and out of it, but the dog no longer can.",3
"In a household with three adult cats I was constantly cleaning the litter box.  With the Littermaid LM900 I need only empty or replace the waste container about twice a week.  The litter is kept clean and smoothed by the automatic raking action.  Odors are minimal since waste is stored in a closed container and the exposed litter is continually cleaned.  Make sure you only use premium, clumping litter.  That's the good news. Now for the not so good news.  The unit is noisy with a capital ""N"".  Don't plan on placing it near the living spaces in your home if you value your peace and quiet.  Waste frequently lodges between the teeth on the rake so I'm finding myself visually checking anytime I'm near the unit and using my scoop to clear the rake.  About every other day I need to use the scoop to scrape along the bottom of the pan to loosen anything sticking to the bottom so the rake can catch it on the next pass.  Lastly, the included ramp which is supposed to keep your cat from tracking litter is a joke.  It simply isn't big enough and my cats usually jump over it rather than walk down it.  To solve the problem, I continue to leave a small area rug in front of the unit.  That seems to catch about 75% of the tracked litter. the unit isn't cheap.  Taking into account the noise and the other problems, I would still buy the unit if I had to do it over again primarily for the conveninence.",3
"The plastic is light-weight, but it does work. We are happy with our LitterMaid litter box. It is about 99% perfect. It still takes a responsible pet owner to oversee any occasional malfunctions. We love ours and would buy it again.",3
I loved the automatic cat box when I had space for it. Now I'm in a smaller space but I've got this in storage for when I can spread out again. :-),3
"What can one say? Cat is happy. Husband is happy. No smell in the house. I'm happy. Everyone with a kitty, or cat, should have this product. It is a time saver, money saver...and just plain marvelous.",3
"This is not a bad product, it is not the best product, but it is pretty good compared to most of them out on the market.  You still wind up having to scoop and clean off the rake, but it's better than the traditional kitty litter box.  We have learned to use small plastic grocery bags as liners.  I recommend this product.",3
"The older version o this litter maid wore out, and this newly designed version is not as satisfactory as the old version.",3
"I purchased this same Littermaid 3 years ago and it is still going strong. We have 3 littermaids, all different models for our 3 cats. I could not possible keep up with cleaning the litter and this sure helps me out a lot. We bought the permanent chute from Litterworks and my husband used an old entertainment center we got for next to nothing at goodwill and it fits 2 littermaids comfortably. If you look at littermaid disposal system at amazon[...] you will see what it sort of looks like. I love the LM9000 but I would agree the LME9000 (elite with the ionic air cleaner) does not work well and it gives littermaid a bad name. If you can find the basic ones I think they work better than the ionic air cleaner ones. We only empty our litter a couple of times a weeks as once it goes down the chute into the trash bag we only have to take the trash bag out. No, it does not smell, I also add a little baking soda to the trash bag but you do have to clean the littermaid occasionally just like any other litterbox, just not as much. I use Worlds Best Litter (corn litter) makes littermaid work easier and cuts down on the dust from litter. It is a shame that the elite's have sullied the littermaid product name. I hope they improve on it as I would like to buy a backup in case one of mine goes (I figure after 3 yrs it's due) but I won't buy another elite with the ionic (read moronic) air cleaner.",3
"This is my second one. I will always use the self cleaning litter box. It is healthier for your cat(s), easier on me and keeps your home cleaner. I live in an apartment and my manager complemented me on how ""well I care for my cats"". My vet says my 14 year old cat looks 7 and I firmly believe this litter maid has something to do with it. He has had the litter main most of his life. My ""skid-dish"" cat, he uses all the time but waits to see it move, kind of funny. All I know is when this one goes, I will buy a new one again. These are worth every penny I spend to have another day with my cats.",3
"We had the smaller version of this box for approximately 15 years before it gave out and broke.  I loved it so much that I wanted to get another one. Due to the large size of one of our cats we decided to get the Mega one.  These machines eliminate order in the house and keeps our dogs away from the box.  Some clumping litters can have the tendency to jam the machine, but the few times to un jam it are still worth having it.  Make sure not to over fill it with litter, we rarely have a problem.",3
"Over the years we have owned a couple of these and this model by far has been the best.  Yes, it does get a little gummed up in the corners beside the rake, but in my experience owning 4 cats, this sure beats emptying litter boxes daily.  I would recommend this to any cat owner that is tired of daily litter box duty.",3
I like that I can get so many in a pack and easy to use.,3
"I have 4 cats and have gone through two Littermaids. After both of them broke I have given up.  Cons - very noisy, wakes you up at night - gets stuck a lot. When it does, it doesn't intelligently back up or stop, it keeps trying to move forward making a loud clicking sound - it can only handle a very small amount of litter otherwise it gets overloaded - the whole thing feels cheaply made. The motor is week and the plastic is flimsy  I love the concept of an automatic litter cleaner like this, unfortunately it just doesn't perform.",3
It did not fit the receptacle as indicated it would.  Litter went everywhere.,3
"I previously had a Mega which worked  a couple years. This one was a Total Disaster. Never could get rake to work, Littermaid customer service (once you finally get to is) was of little help and Orange Onion (don't buy anything from them) sucked. They couldn't care less, at least Littermaid apologized (on one of my three calls). Keep in mind, if you buy it and return it, do it through Littermaid. You only need to send back the battery cover and that blasted pull wire. To get that out ( NO help from Littermaid!), unscrew every single screw and once you get your hands on that wire, don't let it go! Or you have to take out the rest of the screws by the battery compartment. I wasted hours and hours on this. If only they had a good competitor. They're sending me the only thing available, the latest model that most people here seem to hate. sigh..if it doesn't work, I'm giving up totally on Littermaid. I have two cats, so it had its uses.",3
"I love these because I love the litterbox itself, I wish they would just make a reusable one that comes with the box in the first place. I try to reuse these by using a plastic bag, but they are not strong enough to use for the lifetime of the box.",3
"I know that readers will find this hard to believe, or that there must be another explanation, but this is a true and accurate account of our experience with this product.  First, I should say that our cats tend to be a little ""different"".  We've had a cat who always drank water by scooping it up with his paw first.  Cats that figured out how to open the front door.  Cats that stalk dogs and chase them.  You get the idea.  We purchased this gadget in preparation for going out of town, and leaving the cats set up ""home alone"" for the weekend in a large unfinished basement.  They were used to eating and drinking from dispensers, and we always leave backup supplies just in case, so we had the input side of the equation covered.  The output side of things, however, tended to be less than ideal.  Our solution had always been multiple litter pans, and this device seemed like a great improvement.  We sent it up in a clear area, ""introduced"" the cats to its use, and went on our way.  When we got back, we found that the cats did not have the positive response to this device we had hoped.  Not only had the device been turned upside down and emptied, but the batteries had been removed and scattered across the room.  But that wasn't enough.  Our industrious kitties had dragged whatever they could lay paws on over to the unit and buried it in random objects.  While the details of what inspired such a profound ""statement"" were not completely clear, the message was extremely clear.  And so it sits, unused and unloved, spurned by our cats.  And to the list of peculiarities our cats have displayed, we must add the term ""Luddites"".  It is worth mentioning that no other animals had access to the area, including humans.  The box was flat on the floor.  There was no where for it to fall, and absolutely nothing in the vicinity to fall on it.  We are not subject to significant seismic activities.  There were no crop circles in the yard.  Just cats.  Cats with too much time on their hands, and an attitude towards robotic litter boxes.",3
"Fast shipping, exactly as described. Very nice quality. Happy with purchase.",3
"I found out about these litterboxes by going into a pet store for cat supplies when I adopted my cat back in 2005. I liked the idea that I no longer would have to worry about having to scoop out cat waste or have a strong cat waste smell in my home.  I bought the LM920 which I found to have a quiet and decent motor. Unfortunately, it only lasted about three years.  Then I bought the LM900 as the LM920 was no longer made even though it is superior to the LM900 and quieter.  The first LM900 I bought lasted about a year and half, and I found the motor noisy and not very sturdy.  The second LM900 lasted about a year.  I bought the third LM900 and it only lasted two days before the rake stopped in the dumping into the receptacle mode and wouldn't move anymore.  I had to unscrew the rake so I could empty the receptacle which was full of lovely cat waste, dump the current amount of cat litter and return it to Amazon so I could get a replacement.  The replacement one broke also with the rake in the upright position so again, I had to unscrew the rake to get to the almost full receptacle to dump it out. Don't bother buying the Littermaid LM900 model as it is obviously doesn't last.  I went and bought the latest version of the Littermaid which is a LME9000 and it is better with a timer so the rake doesn't run during during a 9 hour duration but I still run into the rake getting stuck at various times and it also pushes unused litter into the receptacle.  I go through way more litter now which is frustrating but it does seem to have a stronger motor.",3
They are thin but work great. They fit just like the manufacturer ones that came with the littermaid automatic litter box.,3
"Unfortunately again.... Another disappointment.   I thought that by purchasing Littermaid Brand they would be made properly, What a disappointment... Let me explain, Buying a Littermaid Comes with Waste receptacles, These Waste containers have an extended Lip that slids in front that keeps waste from being pushed in between waste container and onto the floor.   I'm not sure if this was an effort to save a Penny... Or just Very POOR Quality control. My hope is Littermaid will notice this flaw from there original design and correct it.  At the moment it looks as if I am off to the Pet store to ask them to open a box.",3
I love not having to scoop the cat litter. Favorite invention ever.,3
Sometimes feel flimsy when emptying - but it is used by two cats.  At least I'm not scooping.,3
"Our four cat household needed something better than the two average sized litter boxes we had been using, so we gave the Mega LitterMaid a try. It does have more surface area so the cats like the larger size, and after a couple of days they didn't even worry about the very loud noise of the motor running as the cleaning tines rake the litter. We are impressed with the lack of smell from the box and the covered receptacle.  However, the motor is not strong enough to move some of the very healthy sized clumps that our very healthy cats create after urinating. It strains a lot and finally gives up. We end up having to do some cleaning with the scoop on the bigger clumps since the motor isn't strong enough to handle it. And some of it sticks between the tines, meaning a short daily cleaning. A larger receptacle would also be wonderful- we empty ours daily. If you have one or two cats, this would only be a once-a-week chore. We've had it about a month and overall, we are happy with this item- just wishing for a few design changes to make it really great.  Pros: Big box/surface area, no smell, picks up all the solid waste and the smaller wet clumps. Easy to clean, easy to empty the receptacle, comes with a dozen receptacle replacements (but you'll want to use plastic grocery bags as a liner to save on ordering more).  Cons: Noisy underpowered motor, receptacle is too small for multi-cat household, uses a LOT of expensive clumpfree litter.",3
"I have gone through 2 of these in 5 years.  NEVER again will I purchase a a Littermaid.  This model died Monday after 2-1/2 years, but had been having problems with the rake running continuously until it finally cut off.  The cord finally snapped on Monday.  Not only the short lifespan considering the price, but I found myself spending nearly as much time cleaning the box as I did a regular old litter pan.  No matter what litter brand I tried, it adhered like mud to the bottom of the pan, would stick to the rake, and eventually cause the machine to cut off.  Just purchased an Omega Paws, which has very good reviews and am eagerly awaiting its arrival today so the Littermaid can get tossed.  Good idea, very poor longterm performance.",3
"Very cheaply built, I know it's for cat doo doo, but they are way too flexible and thin. Have to buy them cause that's all that fits the unit!",3
"The plastic rake is spaced in a way that it won't work with my, and my cat's, favorite litter.  Yes it's a clumping litter.  Also the tongs on the rake are very wide.  This litterbox scoops a lot of clean litter into the bin (even with the smallest clumping litter I could find).  It wastes a LOT of litter, pretty much just indiscriminately scooping everything in it's path into the bin... more of a shovel, than a rake IMO.  In order to not waste more litter than is used, I would have to dump out the bin and scoop that in order to save the wasted clean litter.... far more of a hassle than useful.  I would not repurchase this item, nor would I recommend it to a friend.... an enemy.... maybe.",3
Works just fine but no longer in use.  It Crapped out after about six months.,3
"They worked extremely well, this is the only part of the automatic litter box that did not fail. That was an unfortunate fact. I would like to return these but have not had the chance yet I have been very very very busy running a group home and fighting with my own health problems. Thank you, good day",3
"Five cats = Littermaid Mega.  I actually have two Megas because there is always an after breakfast and after dinner rush to use the Littermaid and the unit does have difficulty scooping two large litter clumps at the same time, it can be too heavy and sometimes will take several attempts to succesfully scoop the two large litter clumps.  Also, when you have two cats jockeying to use the Littermaid at the same time, well I just had to get another to keep everyone happy!  As other users state, do not overfill the pan.  Also, line the plastic litter hoppers with grocery store bags and you can reuse, reuse, reuse, reuse them many, many times.  When the plastic litter hoppers crack, I reinforce them with clear packing tape and further extend the use of each one.  My cats all love their Littermaid Megas and we couldn't do without them.  With five cats, I usually find myself emptying the hoppers every other day and doing periodic maintenance on the litterpan to keep it free of flat clumps that stick to the bottom of the pan.  Great invention, wouldn't do without it!!",3
"I have used this and the Elite, and they worked fine until my 12-year old cat developed renal insufficiency.  Now she drinks a lot and pees a LOT.  The clumps of pee got so large that the motor wasn't strong enough to move them any more.  Conventional cat boxes were difficult to clean, and it HAD to be done daily.  So I tried the Omega Paw rolling litter box, and it has done well.  Yes, the plastic connectors do break easily, and litter leaked out from the edges until I bought some wing nuts at home depot (2 on the side with the tray did it) and that solved that problem.  Now I roll the box and dump the tray every 2 days, although I do have to bang on the bottom with my fist to get some of the larger clumps to detach.  Still, it beats the alternatives.  The noise of this box was also very annoying, esp. when you have a sleeping baby.",3
"Good product, i line mine with plastic bags and use for several months.",3
I love my littermaid and these are designed to work perfectly with it.,3
"These are really flimsy and tear easily. I will keep buying them though, because they are the only ones I can find that fit the Littermaid box. I do use them with a bag, which makes them more cost effective because you can use them more than once. Overall, they're fine for what they are.",3
"I had one of these years ago I had given away and then recently bought another one.  Initially, it was a big mess as some other reviewers have experienced - the litter would stick to the bottom, get stuck in the rake, just make a gunky mess and nothing would help - I used silicone spray, cooking spray, took the rake off, etc.  I knew I didn't have these same problems with the Litter Maid before and *finally* I figured out I was using the wrong litter.  I was using Fresh Step clumping, which I used in my other boxes, but after reading other reviewers recommendations I switched.  Now I use Tidy Cat Scoopable for multiple cats (Walm@rt) and it works fantastic.  With one cat, I dump the waste 2x a week - it's takes less than a minute.  A different litter has made a *huge* difference - even the clumps in the receptacle dump out easily, very little left sticking to the inside vs. the other litter.  I know Litter Maid also sells their own brand, but I you don't need to spend the extra $.  Spray the interior of the box and the rake with cooking spray, then put your Tidy Cat in and do not overfill. I researched this, the Litter Robot and the other automatic litter boxes before getting this one.  For the price, I think this is the best value at 20 percent of what the Litter Robot is selling for.  The Litter Robot has a much higher percentage of reviewers giving it 5 stars, but for the difference in price I decided one this model.  From everything I've read, this is the best performing of the Litter Maids, as well.  I definitely wouldn't recommend anything with a smaller waste receptacle, even with one cat - the point is to clean the litter box as little as possible, right?  Also, the price has really come down for some reason - 2 months ago this model was selling at [...] for twice the $77 price tag that Amazon.com is selling it for now.",3
"I paid way too much to find out that the motor makes a lot of noise when cleaning the box. My cat was scared of it even though the timing was set to delay the cleaning. The box takes up a lot of room and has to be plugged in so placement is limited. I also did not like that the soiled litter would stick to the bottom, break into small pieces that the comb would not catch, and often missed the receptacle. I ended up having to clean it out manually to fix the mess left behind. I would rather just scoop it the first time myself and save the hassle....and money. I gave mine to a friend and she eventually had the same complaints about the cleanliness. Her cats used it just fine without fear.",3
"This is my third littermaid in the past 10 years, works fine and great price.",3
"I have four of these and they are a great help.  Some of my cats a are a little finicky about their litterboxes and will stop using them if they're not perfectly clean.  Since I work all day and the cats are on their own, I can count on these self-cleaning litter boxes to keep the box up to my cats' high standards.  My only complaint is LitterMaid's quality control can be a little inconsistent.  Over the years I've had defective units right out of the box a little more often than I'd like.  I don't think it's unique to LitterMaid, I've seen similar QC problems with just about anything made in China.  If LitterMaid has a choice, they really should reconsider where they're doing business.  It's at the point that if I have a choice between products either made in China or elsewhere, I choose the product NOT made in China just because I've been burned too many times by shoddy workmanship, even from supposedly name brand products.",3
Not much to say about these. They work well with the Littermaid litter box and makes cleaning a lot easier.,3
"we bought our first LitterMaid 4 years ago, a LM700. we didn't take special care of it really. I cleaned it well enough to keep it going and it avoided having any of the issues most people complain about... keep good litter in it, clear any jams, use bags in the trays.  that one broke some time this last summer, it would turn on and the motor would try to run then immediately stop and would just stay in the park position. so we bought a LM500. the LM500 would jam and fail about every 5th time so I took the opportunity to inspect the mechanism (since it was new and clean, working on an old one is no fun) and found that the LM500 was significantly cheaper than the LM700. the old one has dual stop and return sensors and a pretty strong motor. taking what I learned I cleaned out and fixed the front sensors on the old one and it started working again and I returned the horrible LM500.  well, the LM700 finally broke for good, sensor or motor, dunno, it won't return or go in reverse. so we ""upgraded"" to the LM900 which only seems to differ in that it has higher sides making it a little quieter. on inspection also noticed that the new one also only has sensors on one side. other than that ""downgrade"" the motor seems stronger and doesn't jam at the same full levels that either of the other two boxes did.  we're pleased so far, since it works better than the trusty LM700 did. we just hope it lasts as long.",3
I HAD THE SMALLER VERSION WHICH WAS GOOD BUT MY CAT GOT BIGGER AND WOULD NOT FIT ANYMORE. SO I HAD TO GET A BIGGER ONE. THIS IS GREAT NO MORE SCRAPING THE TINES OR SIDES. VERY QUIET. THE RAMP DOES MAKE IT HARD TO EMPTY THE WASTE CONTAINER. I USE THE CONTAINER OVER AND OVER UNTIL IT GETS SOILED.,3
"There are definitely tricks and techniques listed in other reviews that will maximize the effectiveness of the litter maid, such as: - keep the litter level within the correct range. - use a marker & draw the fill level guides around the entire tray: makes filling to the correct level easier. - use only fine ground premium clumping litter for best results. - mixing with 1/3 of flushable litter will make the substrate lighter and easier for the machine to handle. - deal with any clogs or blockages that build up on the rake right away. - every couple of months, scrape the rake tines clean with an old butter knife to keep from building up residue. - a bit of baking soda or cat box deodorizer in the catching tray will further reduce odor. - ideally, you should have 1 box for every cat in the house. (We have 6 cats so; 4 regular and 2 LM900s) - don't toss the catch boxes, just dump them out in the trash and you can reuse them multiple times. (saves money)  The littermaid boxes won't solve all your cat box issues but it will scoop more frequently, minimize smell, save time, extend the life of the litter and keep things a lot cleaner and easier in general.  The unit is a bit noisy, takes up a bit more space than a regular box and requires a power outlet to be close by.",3
"This machine never worked the way it was advertised to.  It cannot handle urine, the urine clumps and scooper gets caught on it.  This stresses the motor out to were it resets itself, thus not scooping anything.  Or if it does break through it, the clump crumbles to small enough pieces where it slips through the scooper and quickly starts to stink.  I tried five different types of litter, nothing improved the machines performance.  I ended up keeping a hand scooper and plastic bags available as I had to scoop and clean it myself.  The plastic mounts on the scooper ended up snapping of after two months of use.  The box is just messy and useless and hard to wash as you have to disassemble it. You might as well buy litter tray for $5, it will function 100 times better.  I use a plastic concrete mixing tray you can get at home depot for $6.  It looks just like a litter tray except it is about 2' x 3'.  If you got the room this is the way to go.  If you decide to buy this auto-box save the receipt.  You will need it  If you want a good auto-box, get the one that uses the disposable trays with the blue crystals.  That is a good auto-box.",3
Doesn't fit all that great. They seem to be taller then the originals that come with the litter box,3
"Box was opened and retaped when I got them, but I am not sure what's wrong with these liners.  NONE of them fit either one of my Littermaid boxes. I don't know if some others were switched in the box or what, but the entire 12 pack, every single one of them, the trays are about a 1/2"" too narrow and they sort of look different. They don't look like the ones I've been buying for my smaller littermaid box, or my largest littermaid in over a year.",3
"This is my 4th littermaid in about 12-15 years.  I've always found them to be great, but not very long lived. My littermaids have serviced 2 cats at all times.  So, if you are a single cat house, you could reasonably expect 5-7 years of use from one of these.  The first unit's motor died.  The second, the spring in the power rake's cord broke, and couldn't reel in the cord anymore.  The third (my last) up and died, no warning or otherwise.  Just stopped running. My first Littermaid was the original.  It lasted about 4 years.  The next was the original ""Mega Advance"" and was the best when it was working.  That only lasted about 3-4 years.  The last Mega (not advance) lasted about 5-6 years, but was very noisy. This newer unit seems to be basically the same as the last Mega, but the motor is slightly more quiet and pushes the rake through the box at a faster clip.  Both nice improvements.  The included scoop has tines in it to clean out the rake, a great idea that only took 15 years.... I've never run my Littermaids on batteries, always using the A/C plug.  If the power's out for a few hours, we can survive, or if needed, scoop. If there was a way to make the system a bit more quiet it would be perfect.  Tips: 1.  Don't over-fill the box.  Use the bottom (add litter) line as the top fill line.  If you fill to the top line, the system will not work as well.  This seems to be the #1 problem people have, adding too much litter. 2.  Use a bit of cooking oil spray (Pam) on the bottom of the pan before you fill with litter.  I rarely clean ours, but when I do, I always spray the bottom of the pan and that really helps keep the box cleaner and helps keep the nasty stuff from getting stuck to the bottom. 3.  Use high-quality clumping litter.  We get the big tub of Scoop-Away from Costco.  That lasts more than a month for us. 4.  Re-use the waste containers.  They each should last a month or more. Just keep using them until they crack when you are removing to dump the contents.  Then replace.  Saves lots of money there.  This would be a 5 star if it was just a bit more quiet overall.",3
I like it-but it does freak out the cat.  That's ok because my cat is neurotic anyway.  The ramp doesn't help much as the cat leaps over it leaving cat litter everywhere.  Why doesn't someone invent cat litter that doesn't track!!!!  Update...bloody thing broke after 3 months!,3
They work well and can be reused if emptied frequently and line them with baking soda and a Costco cleaning towel ripped in half.,3
"i'm a cat lover of the first order, and presently own 4 Himalayan Seal Points. this product is a dream come true. with a little care and common sense, it does everything they say it does. after years of digging and scratching around in litter boxes myself, it's a joy to own something that brings the process into the 21st Century. some thoughts: use the premium litters they recommend. anything else, and you'll be cleaning the rake and scraping the bottom of the tray more often than would be necessary. spray the bottom of the tray with silicone from time to time. it makes the operation much smoother. don't overfill it. the cats will naturally form mounds in the litter, in the process of trying to ""bury"" their waste, so smooth the litter around in the tray now and then, to keep it even. keep the unit set on a piece of old carpet, and keep a hand-vac  nearby. small granules make litter tracking a little more of an issue. forget about the tent. if you like to keep the box as clean as your cats probably like to have it, the tent makes the box impossible to get to, and work around in. the disposable trays are very handy. they're stiff plastic. line them with a small garbage bag, or wash them out and reuse them. throwing them out every time is an expensive proposition. keep your supply of litter next to the box. (i store it in one of those plastic stackable bins.) as the volume of litter is reduced just add more as needed. you'll be dumping the whole tray a lot less often. with 4 cats, i clean the entire unit about once every two weeks. i use a lot less litter, and spend almost no time dealing with the waste itself. any issue with smell is easily dealt with by sprinkling a little baking soda in the waste receptcle from time to time. all in all it's a very fine product, that makes caring for your pets much more efficient.",3
These work so wonderfully with the receptacles and just saves so much money.,3
I like the whole concept of the automatic scooper & the disposable receptacles.  I wish they had a tighter fit to prevent litter from leaking between the fittings.,3
These are great for my cat's litter maid auto matic litter cleaning poopy box!!,3
"I am very happy with how long this product lasted.  Mine is a little over 8 years old, and it just broke the other day.  While i will admit the bins are kind of expensive and it is noisy...  It lasted for 8 years without any user error related issues!  7 of those years it was used by 2 cats, now just one.  I am very happy with the product, and have every intention of replacing it!",3
"This device is overall a great product. The litterbox smell is virtually gone, just dump all the ""kitty prizes"" when the compartment gets full and you're good to go.  I've had great luck with fresh step litter.  Every once in awhile it will get a jam in it and you have to use the tool to clear it. But even with that infrequent problem this thing has made my laundry room 100x more bearable.",3
"As a foster furmomma for a cat rescue and a cat slave to my own cats, this prodcut is a dream come true and has been saving my life for 10 years now! Worth every penny you pay (if you avoid the high retail) and worth the time it saves.  Yes, they do break down, what doesn't?  But with a little care and obvious common sense these work for YEARS!  You do have to break them down a few times a year for a good cleaning and keep the track the rake rides in halfway clean, but otherwise still the best thing. I will never be without them or without a spare in the closet just in case! One suggestion is that the manufacturer scale back the side panels of the receptacle lid so that these can function in a smaller space when the rake hit it, such as in a  closet without hitting the doors.  I have 4 of these units in a closet, two on the floor and two on a shelf a little higher and have them side by side.  I broke one when the lid sides pushed against the back inside of the closet door when raking to the receptacle because someone had shut the closet dorr partially. So making those ""flaps"" shorter would greatly reduce the actual amount of space the units need to take up functionally.",3
"I thought I would have to purchase a new littermaid for my beloved cat Sushi.  Suddenly, the rake stopped working even though the power supply seemed to be working.  Yes, I was having all the problems that others mentionned like the rake's inability to deposit clumps into the receptacle and jamming. (I will have to give the spray coating with Pam a try.)  This time the unit simply would not move and there was nothing on the littermaid website that even came close to addressing the problem.  But...after contacting customer service, I learned that there seem to be two sensors/buttons that can be pushed in at both ends of the rake track. They are pretty small so look hard. In my case a small piece of litter caught by the button caused the malfunction.  We got the piece of litter out and the box is working again.  I still cannot give Littermaid a high rating because no matter how good the clumping litter, or how carefully I fill it, we still have problems with it being unable at times to effectively get rid of used litter.",3
"This is the 2nd Littermaid I've had, and the original was definitely better. It lasted 9 years and cleaned very well. This new one cleans well about half the time, the other times is doesn't pick up all the deposits. The tines don't reach all the way to the bottom, so you still have to scrape wet litter off the bottom occasionally. But, all in all, it's better than cleaning the box 8 times a day (my cats are picky), just an occasional check and quick scoop, otherwise I have a lot more free time! BTW, I use Worlds Best Litter, it's made from corn, all natural, no toxic clay dust or additives. It makes the box fairly odorless, and clumps OK. I think a better clumper might work better in the Littermaid, but I'm not trading the all natural benefit for my cats just for convenience for me.",3
"I love this litter box. I do not use the lids, and keep using the same receptacle until it tears or cracks. (Usually 3-4 months). I just dump it out a couple times a week. Makes these things last forever",3
These aren't always at every store so it's very handy Amazon carries these at a decent price.  Getting it on prime is always a bonus.,3
The plastic is to thin and cracks easily. I try to re-use a few times finally bought an insert you can use to put bags inside receptacles to last longer.,3
"I have now purchased a total of 4 of these.  It seems that after 4-5 years the motors finally give out.  - However, that is 4-5 years of it sweeping the litter clean multiple times every day.  I have three cats and I always have 2 of these boxes in use.  Primarily I bought them after I adopted a rescue kitten - who as it turned out, has the coronavirus that can cause Feline Infectious Peritonitis (FIP). Some apparently healthy cats may carry the virus which can be shed intermittently in bodily fluids or feces, with feces being the most common source of oral infection.  She is completely healthy by all other standards - but if she or the other two catch a cold, or feel stressed etc., this coronavirus can surface. Much like a herpes virus in humans. And like the herpes virus it is easily transmitted. With cats the primary method that they transmit illness to each other is through feces.  With the LitterMaid automatic box - the potential for all the cats to  step on or otherwise put a nose to each other's waste is almost completely eliminated. (with 2 boxes - I have never seen one cat go into a box right after a cat has used it. - They go to the other one, which is clean and ready for their use)  And because I can work some very long hours. 16-18 hrs some days. I feel a bit more assured knowing the box is keeping itself clean.  It does take a bit to get used to as far as the noise of the rake and what it takes to do a through clean.  But, as I like them so much for what they do that I don't mind the maintenance. Which isn't as involved as it would seem. It's actually rather simple to clean with a wet handrag and the occasional vacuum or dustbuster (which can be said of almost all litter boxes)  Another advantage -- you don't need much litter and it goes much further. You do need to use a premium letter (I use 'the World's Best Litter') - but because it lasts as long as it does, it is a financial bargain.",3
"I've used these for about ten years and I keep a spare on hand because it is just a machine and it will eventually wear out, although I've never had one fail. The receptacles are expensive and difficult to clean, but there's a way to keep things clean and a receptacle can last a year or more. Just purchase a box or roll of 3 or 4 Quart trash bags. Try both to see which suits you best. Then simply put the bag in the receptacle, fold the sides and ends down and put the receptacle in the machine. When the receptacle is full just take out the receptacle, remove the bag with its contents, tie the top in a knot to contain the odor, and put it in the trash. The receptacle remains perfectly clean and can be used until it falls apart. This method has probably saved me many hundreds of dollars over the years and takes all the mess and cleaning out of the process.",3
"Having 3 female cats and not home all the time, I am a big believer in the LitterMaid LM 900. I have purchased many LiterMaids over the years and find the LM900 works the best; in fact I am getting ready to purchase my 3rd.  I have bought the newer LiterMaid models, but they just don't work that well. My last LM900 has lasted about 3 years. Recently, it just does not have the power to get over the hump to get the waste into the receptacle, or it catches and ""things"" go flying everywhere. Overall it is worth the cost of having to replace the LM900 every so many years, especially if you have fussy girls like mine that like a clean box.",3
"This thing has a number of problems with it. None really prevents it from performing its function (eventually) but all add up to a real pain. One problem is that the plastic boxes that the cat manure is scooped up into do not fit very well into their canister. As a result cat litter seeps through the gaps and you end up having to vacuum underneath every few days. It should not have been that difficult to make a better fitting plastic box or area where it is to be placed.  A second problem is that the red ""fill"" line is misleading. If litter is filled up to that point (or even fairly close to it) the machine jams. As a result, to prevent jamming, one needs to fill the device with far below its full capacity. This, in turn, necessitates filling the machine with more cat litter than should be the case (i.e., twice a week instead of once).  A third problem is that the rakes, many times, get jammed due to filling up with litter. The rakes should have been made further apart to reduce this.  In short, the machine does do its job but with a few relatively minor modifications (that should have been easy to spot for the manufacturer) this machine could have been much improved. _______________________________ Update: After less than one year machine breaks down and needs to be replaced. Tech support provided by company of very limited use in even determining how (possibly) to fix the problem (assuming it can be to begin with). Hence a one star product.",3
These are the exact same ones that come with the littermaid. My original set came with carbon filters but this set did not. I can usually reuse them for several weeks. I'll just dump it out for a week or so then hose it out if things start sticking to it. If your gentle enough this pack could last you a year.,3
Littermaid is a pretty good cat box and I needed to buy more of these so went to my Amazon account got them in two days,3
"This item works fine until it gets crudded up with dried on poop and litter. It's a nightmare to clean, and my box went dead after 6 months. I wrote to the company TWICE and got no response at all! I would advise against buying this product. It takes less time to rake out a litter box 1-2 times a day, than to clean the mess that this box creates! And yes, I did use the recommended litter -- it made no difference!!",3
"My Littermaid finally broke after 3 years. Pretty good lifespan I think.  I decided to try a different automatic box with a better design. Mistake.  I will go back to the Littermaid Mega that works consistently better than the others.  See all the tricks I've learned to make it a better box at the bottom of my review.  Pros: Had one for 3 years and know it works. Rakes the sand flat and scoops most of the debris consistently. You can use a plastic grocery bag in the litter receptacle. Fresh Step litter works great. Smell is barely noticeable in the room the box is in. I got a plug in deodorizer and that took care of that problem. You can't smell it anywhere else in the house. With two cats I only have to empty the bin twice a week.  Cons: Track inside box gets litter in it. Litter falls between the box and the litter receptacle. Box is difficult to do a thorough cleaning. I did get the whole thing wet and thought I fried the motor, but after it dried it worked fine again. The low level of litter you need to use (I use less than they say and it works better) sometimes makes the pee stick to the bottom of the pan. Noisy.  If you are thinking of the Smartscoop see my review on that piece.. Pooper Flicker! I have more urine balls and fecal balls on the outside of the box.  The littermaid with all it's flaws is still the best product.  TRICKS: Use a little less litter than they recommend Use a grocery bag in the litter receptacle and reuse receptacle over & over. Spray bottom of box with No-Stick Litter Box spray (or cooking spray)and it keeps the pee from gooing up on the bottom. Don't use the ramp as it makes more of a mess. (unless you have a kitten). When the machine stops running don't assume it is broken!!!!  There are two reset tabs at the end of the track on the receptacle end.  Flip up the lid and look on both sides of the track.  There are two little white tabs.  Push those and the box will reset.  That little tid bit was from Littermaid support line and it has worked numerous times. Get one of those little dustbin brushes and brush out the litter in the track every now and again. Put some newspaper or cardboard under the receptacle so it catches the litter that falls through.  Then you can pull it out and dump litter back in box.",3
"What a great product! I bought one 7 years ago and it got tons of use (5 cats).  The new one works great, I have 3 litter boxes and now at least one is always clean.  I like the new scooper that cleans between the rake.  Cat's have no problem using it and were never afraid of the motor- they actually are curious and think it is interesting.  I Highly recommend this one for every cat owner!!!",3
"We have from two to four cats at a time in our home, and managing the litter box is something we want to be as easy as possible. This LitterMaid LM500 Automated Litter Box was the first automated solution we tried. I'm afraid it wasn't our last, as it had numerous problems.  First, the tines would get clumped full of stuff and it would get caked solid rather quickly. I'll note that we didn't even try having this be the ""only"" litter box in our home! We had two others there too. We just wanted to see how well this worked. The storage container would get jammed in the open position, so that it did not do a good job of managing stench.  However, we could have dealt with those issues. We could have cleaned the tines daily, and pushed down the lid ourselves regularly. The real problem was far more serious.  First, understand how this works. The system sense motion and then X minutes after the cat has left the area, the tines move across, dragging any solids and clumps with it, pushing those items into the receptacle plastic box at the far end. Then the tines return to their original position and wait for a new visit.  What happened with our unit would be that the tines would decide that they were ALWAYS ON and would keep going back and forth, back and forth, driving the poor kitties to distraction. There was no way they were going to jump in there and try to do their business while a set of metal tines was growling towards them!  We tried several times to fix this, but it really just wasn't worth it. We moved on to other options and found a GREAT one. This one went in the trash as we couldn't even imagine subjecting any other cat owner to it. A large waste of money.  Not well recommended.  I'll give it 2/5 stars on the assumption that some units do NOT do that random motion thing - but it would only take one fritz in a lifetime to really demolish a cat's desire to ever use the unit again :)",3
Do you have a pile of used litter at the very front of the pan?  Most likely if you are having problems with this product you've put too much litter in the pan.  If you don't think that is the case your little kitty has piled all the litter in the front.  My little darling was doing this to the pan for weeks before I figured out that I needed to use less than the recommended amount of litter.  The motor isn't strong to prevent injury to the kitty if for some reason they are in it when it starts.  It does have a motion sensor so it shouldn't be an issue.  Also if you have more than one cat get more than one of these.  I have 3 cats and three of these.  The stinkers sometimes jam it up but it is still better than the every day cleaning.  We clean ours twice a week on trash days so we can dump straight into the garbage that is going out to the curb that morning.  We use rubber gloves (the hospital kind) to pull out the boxes of used litter.  We dump those and put the receptacles back.  We only replace when the are really bad or tear when they are pulled out.,3
"I bought 2 when I just got my kittens, they did work well for a couple of weeks maybe a month without a big issue Very noisy, a mess to change the containers, litter gets stuck all over the parts and the engine runs back and forth for hours!! Better than Purrforma",3
"I have actually had two of these machines. The first one I used for about a year before the motor burned out. I had tried other mechanized pooper scoopers and this one did a barely acceptable job. It always clogged with large 'loads,' and the rakes would get clogged with my cat's excrement. The second one I bought was actually the latest model and it did an even worse job. I spent more time cleaning up 'after' the box than I ever did with an old-fashioned litter box. Then in frustration, I went to the message boards and found salvation: The Litter Robot (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Litter-Robot-LRII-Automatic-Self-Cleaning-Litter-Box-Black/dp/B000LJFQF4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Litter Robot LRII Automatic Self-Cleaning Litter Box, Black</a>).  What a difference a scooper makes! It never clogs, there's never any after-pooping clean-up, and I can use small trash bags instead of the more expensive catchers they recommend. With a large cat, the Robot will fill up after about 1 or 2 weeks. It has a big area to store the poop, it's out of the way, and it doesn't smell! How this thing works exactly is ingenious, and worth the price tag (yes, it's up there). But for sheer simplicity and not having to deal with clogged and dirty boxes, I would gladly pay more. Well, maybe not that much more!  My friends tell me it looks like an MRI machine, and I can't disagree. The Robot's footprint is the same as the litter maid, except it has more height. It looks nice, works great, and my cat took to it immediately. It has built-in sensors that tell it when the cat is done, and if the cat goes near it during it's rotation, it shuts off for 10 minutes until it detects that it's safe to resume. Amazing! I'm sure you can find it cheaper elsewhere (Hint to Amazon to make the price more competitive), but with shipping charges it may be a wash. Of course you can go to the pet store and buy one (just call ahead to be sure they have it in stock).  That's it. Toss the Maid out on her ear and get a Robot. You get all the cleaning without any of the pain.",3
"When functioning properly, this is a great product, however and unfortunately, the Litter Maids have mechanical/electrical flaws.  Over the past 4 to 5 years, I have bought several Litter Maids (have several Kitties) and five of the units have failed.  Of the last two I purchased (within the last 4 weeks) one of these has already failed.  The rake will not go into park...will not stop.  Thus the unit is of no use. These units have been on the market for several years.  Surely they could have made the necessary quality improvements by now.  Don Johnson",3
Working fine.  We have lost our cats recently and will no longer use it.  Will attempt to give to a deserving cat owner.,3
"These would have been great if I hadn't returned the litterbox.  Did not need them, so they were returned for refund.",3
"Cheap 'n' cheezy, just like all the newer LitterMaid receptacles are.  Sure wish they would bring back the older, sturdier ones.  Really makes you feel like a captive market, since you don't have much choice but to use these if you want to use the LitterMaid.  I line them with bags, but the receptacles are so thin that they crack and split after about 3-4 uses just from putting them into and taking them out of the LitterMaid, so have to be replaced despite being lined.",3
"Owning a cat just doesn't get any easier.  If I forget to clean the box for a day, no problem; it has been raked into a receptacle for me.  I just add litter every so often and empty the receptacle twice a week.  I do dismantle and wash the base monthly.  This litterbox frees me to leave for several days without guilt. If the caretaker misses a day, no problem.  I highly recommend this for any household with a litterbox.",3
"The theory behind this litterbox is genius, but it doesn't work as advertised.  My cat urinates in the back corner, and the rake never could get it.  It would scrape off part of the clump, which would get stuck to the rake, but it would leave the majority of it in the corner.  The clumps would stick the bottom of the pan, and it was a real pain to clean them off.  I had to scoop this litterbox and clean the rake off 4 times in the two days I used it, which is twice as much as I scoop my regular litterbox in a whole week!  Don't waste your money.",3
"The receptacles I got with my first Littermaid (for multiple cats) were very flimsy. The replacement box of 12 (as shown) I got afterward were also flimsy.  This did not stop us from reusing the trays over and over.  It doesn't make sense not to, but eventually they get pretty brutalised from removal and reinsertion.  Oddly enough, when we got our second LitterMaid (regular sized) the receptacles that came with it were sturdier and more durable.  Why they aren't all manufactured at this thickness is beyond me.  Actually, I'm sure it's a case of trying to get more money out of us at cheaper manufacturing cost, but it's a little ridiculous when they are that flimsy.",3
"Current version of littermaid does not work well at all. The first one I purchased lasted for five years and I was very happy with it. The pet store only had the larger version when I replaced the original. The larger version lasted for 15 months and then died.  I found the old version (on Amazon). It worked for six days and then died. It was replaced at no charge. The second one worked for six weeks and then died. I have been told it is not possible to get my money back because it has been more that 30 days since the original purchase. So now I am out a wad of money and have to run the box manually.  DO NOT buy this product. This system forced me to give this product at least one star, I would give it -5 if I could.",3
I prefer this automatic litter box over the others.  I cant tell you how easy it to have and the upkeep cost is very low.  You can also obtain a hard shell insert instead of using the disposable ones.  I owned this product and ended up going back to this product!,3
"We had a Litter Maid cat box several years ago and we loved it.  They have ""improved"" their product and ruined it in my opinion.  The rake gets clogged and litter sticks all over the place and in the tracks no matter what level of litter you use. We tried every type of litter available, including the ridiculously expensive litter that Litter Maid sells.  We spent more time cleaning this worthless litter box than we would have in scooping out regular litter.  We contacted the manufacturer, but they won't stand behind their product and we could not return it to the store because we did not have the original box, although we did have the receipt.  After a couple of months we threw it out in the garbage.  I won't waste my money on any other product Liter Maid sells.  Save yourself this frustration and find another brand.  I would not have given this item even one star, but one star is the lowest rating.",3
"My previous Littermaid box was over 4 years old and finally quit (it's used by 2 cats daily).  After checking reviews on the newer Littermaid models, I decided to stay with the LM500 and I don't regret it. The litter box size is a little smaller than the old box, but it works great (my cats each weigh about 7-3/4 lbs, they're small cats, so the size difference wasn't a major problem). I have no regrets getting this model again.  Sometimes I have to scrape the kitty goo from the bottom of the box where it seeps and coagulates, but I had to do that with the old box too. When you change and clean the litter box section, wipe some baby oil on the bottom of the pan before you add new litter, it helps to lift the coagulated kitty goo more easily.",3
"When I received the Littermate it did not work. I called Littermate customer service. Tech support tried to reconcile the problem, but could not. So, they did replace it, for $10 more and I had to send them a bunch of proof of purchase stuff. At any rate, they did send me a new one, but it is very finicky, it sometimes works, even with premium clumping litter, it works sporadically, For such a costly product, it is disappointing.",3
"I gave 5 stars because i've had three Litter Maids over about 12-13 years and have always been very grateful not to have to clean the catbox--i was able to forget about it for at least a couple of weeks at a time, sometimes much more. I have only one small cat.  You can't beat not having to think about the catbox, it's almost like not having one at all--compared to the old fashion litter box.  I first saw the Litter Maid in the LA Times Magazine around 1995, there was a full page ad, and you could pay in three installments, it was expensive, at least a couple hundred.  Catbox scooping depressed me so i ordered one.  Mine worked right out of the box.  it's always tricky putting the right amount of litter in.  If i put too much, it just keeps recycling and raking until i take some out.  Following the instructions, i found that there would be too much litter and the machine would malfunction, but if i put it lower than the limit line, it would be fine.  I had some kind of technical problem in the beginning, i can't remember what, and was pleased with their tech support, they took care of me, way back then.  After a few years, it stopped working and i gladly got another one.  At some point, i began using Litter Pearls cat litter in it when that first came out.  That was yet another technical advance for my situation.  The Litter Pearls absorbed the urine so there was less stuff getting scooped into the box, and i was able to go even longer without being reminded of the litter box.  In the beginning, Litter Pearls was just regular little round pearls. Then, my pet store came out with ""lite tracking litter pearls"" which were not round. They made them irregular shaped and rough, to prevent tracking i guess. That new light tracking style did not agree with my Litter Maid.  It was too granular and it jammed up the mechanism.  My pet store stopped carrying the regular non-lite tracking kind of Litter Pearls, so i had to search for an alternative.  The combination of those little round litter balls and the Litter Maid did great things for my quality of life.  I did not want to go backwards into using the old fashioned kind of litter. I was ready to buy the regular Litter Pearls from the company in another state, (i called around) if necessary, or on eBay, but i was able to find another brand that had the round balls in a local store, the brand is Litter Secret, i couldn't find the product on the web though.  As long as i had the little round ball litter, not the lite tracking kind, my Litter Maid performed consistently.  The second one lasted several more years with never a mechanical problem.  Long ago, i got the tent. I would always use a tent with the Litter Maid.  For me, the less evidence of a litter box the better.  The Litter Maid rake did not clean easily and with my policy of not paying a lot of attention to the litter box, eventually the second Litter Maid got messy and the price had come way down on them, so i decided rather than clean it, i'd just get a new one.  the motor was still working fine, there was no problem with it after several years. I just didn't feel like cleaning it, was working lots of overtime and my job and felt i could afford a new one. I've had the third one for several more years, it has been very low maintenance, no mechanical problems, i just have cleaned it every few weeks, i'm not sure how often, maybe 2 weeks, maybe more, it seems long between times when i have to deal with it.  Recently it stopped working.  The light was on but without warning, it wouldn't become active, it just sat there.  I got a Litter Robot to replace it, because of the great reviews and decided i would try a change, since LItter Robot will let you return it for 60 days.  I'm still evaluating the Litter Robot, but there are some things that so far, i like better about the Litter Maid, one is, i didnt' have to regularly clean the Litter Maid, just take out the plastic containers, and then do a big cleaning once in a great while.  I think i'm going to have to clean the Litter Robot more often.  The Litter Maid plastic containers were easier for me to switch out and replace than the plastic bags for the Litter Robot, less struggle, less time spent bending over the ""dreaded area.""  And more secure feeling because stiff plastic is thicker than a plastic bag.  Being inside the tent, the LItter Maid didn't have anything directly exposed to open air, whereas the Robot sits there with its door open and litter sitting out there in contact with the rest of the world.  Having said all of that, the LItter Robot is very cool.  More ingenious than the LItter Maid.  anyone could dream up the LItter Maid.  It would take a special kind of mind to think up the Litter Robot.  Watching it do its thing is something to behold, in terms of human engineering.  I was very happy with the LItter Maid, my three worked reliably and flawlessly each one for many years.  I didn't have to deal with tech support.  But again, i had only one small cat.  Oh, i almost forgot. My cat always liked to use only one side of the Litter Maid, so the waste would pile up on one end of the plastic container, causing it to fill up faster, only on that side, than it would if it had been distributed evenly.  When it fills up and doesn't close completely, that's when i can smell it and i go into action to change the container, but i alway would find that half the container wasn't used, it was empty on one side, full on the other. This never affected the mechanical performance of the Litter Maid itself.  Update:  10/3/10  I have just retired my most recent Litter Maid which i started using a year ago.  I was having a very hard time with it.  It worked well as far as the motor and everything it's supposed to do, but the problem  was with the litter (crystals). The crystals were getting saturated in only about 4 days and if i didn't change the litter, my cat would pee on the floor cover that i kept under the litter maid.  That is way too frequent to have to deal with cat sewage, by my standards.  Urine was getting all over the box and under the box. I thought the litter maid was leaking but couldn't find any openings.  It took me a long time to figure out that my cat's hyperthyroid condition was causing her to excessively urinate.  When i realized it, about two months ago, i doubled her medication and the problem has gone away. but she continued to refuse to use the Litter Maid, i think it must've developed an odor because of all the urine all over it, i tried to wipe it off but far from perfectly i'm sure.  Even though the crystals weren't saturated at all, she was peeing on the floor cover.  So i have just replaced the Litter Maid with a ScoopFree automatic box. So far it's working great. I took the Litter Maid outside, cleaned it as best i could with diluted Simple Green spray, it looks ok, i put it some big plastic bags and will keep it in the garage.  It has been working very well.  A real trooper.  I want to say that i appreciate the Litter Maid, it served me well for about 16 or more years, about 5 of them over those years, two were thrown out not because they wore out but because they were dirty so in my experience they have worked well. I never had a problem with the motors, and i was always impressed at the way it just kept raking over and over, never giving out.  This is different from some peoples' experience.  I want say that i have always used Litter Pearls crystals in the litter Maid, not clay or clumping litter, and that may be why i haven't had the same problems some have had.  I would recommend using crystal litter with it, but in my experience, it had to be the rounded kind, not the trackless/lite tracking kind which are irregularly shaped.  The trackless kind were too abrasive and jagged for the litter maid, they jammed it up, causing the rake to come to a painful creaking halt in mid cycle. But the rounded ones work well, they just aren't easy to find because people tend to prefer lite tracking litter.  But other than that, the crystals have always worked great in the Litter Maid.",3
"I actually won this litter box in a drawing. I was planning on buying one any way. Glad I didn't, it started having problems after five weeks. Of course if I had purchased it, I would take it back and get a new one. But I'm having the same problems others have had, it has a hard time moving a clump of litter sometimes and starts clicking, it wastes litter and now it goes through 5 cycles EVERY time it sweeps even if there is only a small amount and it scoops it the first time.  It's under warranty but the company wants $10 to ship new parts. I'm not paying 10 cents for their mistake (made in China by the way). When it quits completely, I'll go back to the good old plain litter box.",3
"If you own a littermaid self cleaning litter box you have no choice but to buy these receptacles.  I agree they are flimsy and not worth the cost but the company apparently doesn't pay any attention to customer feedback. If I wanted to spend quality time with my cat litter wrapping bags around the box, I would have an $8.00 litterbox and scoop it myself. I agree the manufacturer should be ashamed of this product.",3
"I find that the Littermaid works very well for what it is designed to do. The only truly unpleasant task is changing these waste receptacles. The difficulty I seem to experience is inserting a new receptacle. It is difficult to get the thin retaining lip on the tray itself securely under the plastic flanges attached to the litter box which retain the tray. Once it is in place, it works like a champ, but in a future redesign, I hope that the good folks that design this fine line of electric self-cleaning cat boxes will develop a more secure retaining method that facilitates easier receptacle changeout.",3
"The receptacles have been reduced in thickness. They bend and break easier now. A sturdier, reusable receptacle would be better.",3
Very pleased. I have ownd a Littermaid for the past 8 years and have found this product to be a great time saver. My cat never has a dirty litter box and I use a great deal less litter. This is my second littermaid in 8 years. the first one was no longer auto cleaning and required a manual reset to get the cleaner to run. I beleive the sensor was bad. I was tired of having to remember to reset it so I bought another one. Definately worth the money!,3
"I bought the LM900 at a yard sale 7 years ago for $5!- I've learned a few tricks over the years to get the most out my bargain. This is not a totally maintenance free box - you have to treat it nicely! We have three large Wegies - OMG! Do you know how big the badders are on those babies? Clumps the size of boulders, I tell you! I use scoopaway litter, though it does sometimes get stuck in the corners.  To prevent sticking, I use a light coating of heavy duty silicone spray on the bottom of the (clean)box, rake and track.  Voila, problem solved!  Also, you may have seen the ads for the cart (Litterwo***)to put your littermaid onto.  Being the bargain conscious Mom that I am, I did not spend the $100+ for that cat waste marvel. I put my littermaid on a small(kid)table in the laundry room.  I cut the bottom out of a receptacle and used duct tape to firm up the sides of the receptacle. Next, I used a heavy duty shopping bag (UnderArmor- perfect fit) and folded the top over the receptacle lip. Secure bag to receptacle with duct tape. Cut the bottom of the bag open. Use another thin piece of duct tape across the edge of the box to hold the receptacle in place (only to the edge, not flapped over into the box).  Slide the box so that your new chute hangs off the end and run it into a small trash can lined with a quality Target shopping bag - (Walmart bags rip). All the clumps automatically go into your now huge receptacle, easily emptied by a small child! (Smart thinkin' huh?) Just give it a looksie every couple of days and add more litter, sending aforementioned small child in to replace Target bags. Bonus- you no longer have to buy $12 a box receptacles! For now we're planning eldercare for this box - do I hold the record for longest owned box? When it dies we will replace it with the same model - whatever the price.",3
"We have two of the Littermaid Mega LM900 litter boxes, and would buy another one.  They work reasonably well, and save a lot of scooping time & effort.  As other reviewers have noted, it works OK, but not perfect.  Help is needed at times, but it's still a big benefit to have.  The rakes need to be cleaned periodically, since the clumps are not fully dried after 10 minutes.  And the litter needs to be redistributed away from the collection box several times each week as a result of the rakes getting filled with wet clumps.  Our cats used it almost immediately after it was set up, and still seem to enjoy watching it operate.  We have had one unit for about 18 months, and added a second recently.  Both work equally well.  We use plastic grocery bags in the collection box, which is easier than using the plastic boxes.  You may wish to add a timer to turn it off over-night, so it doesn't wake you.",3
"I have multiple cats and have tried many different litter boxes.  With the exception of one unit, this has been my favorite of them all.  As long as you have good clumping litter, it works beautifully.  The only drawbacks are that it can be a little messy disposing of the waste and the litter goes around the unit, but it is easy to clean.",3
"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/LitterMaid-LM900-Self-Cleaning-Litter-Box/dp/B00005MF9U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">LitterMaid LM900 Self-Cleaning Litter Box</a> Well it's ok.  Still have to clean it out because it does not pick up all the waste.  When my cat goes in the corner the waste is not picked up at all. It also takes a lot of litter out when it cleans so litter has to be added often.  However, it is better than cleaning a regular litter box every day.  All in all I like it better than a regular litter box.",3
I have three cats and decided to try this automatic litter box.  I have one young cat and two older ones.  The younger one watched me put it together and set it up.  She was quite intrigued by the raking motion.  She immediately used it upon final set up.  Then laid there and waited for the raking to begin.  When the raking finished she jumped in again and then jumped out.  Then she laid there to wait for the raking to begin again.  I also bought one for the upstairs and have had no problems with that one either.  I am looking forward to less mess and smell.  I can see and smell the difference already.,3
"The Good Stuff: My cats love this litter box. When I'm cleaning it they pace around me like a child waiting for their teddy bear to come out of the wash. When I had one cat the bin needed to be emptied once a week. Now with 2 it's more like every 3 days. I line the bin with a little trash bag and it works great. No need to buy the expensive receptacles. Every so often I'll have to use the special litter scoop that comes with it to scrape some ""left over"" off the rake. It does make a noise but it's not that loud. I recommend leaving it in a closet or laundry room. Guests always ask why my boiler room is making noise. The noise doesn't bother my cats, they actually come running to watch it work. It is, however, the only litter box they've ever known.  The Catch: I bought the box in April and had no problems until late October when I realized the box was getting very full. The censors had stopped working. I called their customer service, who's pre-recorded message makes you think you've called the wrong number (they start talking about tools), and spoke with some friendly but not 100% knowledgeable people. They gave me all kinds of instructions on how to fix it myself like dusting off the censors, ""re-setting"" the box by clicking the switches 10 times each, etc. All of these things I tried as they are in the instructions but I humored them. Finally they gave me instructions on how to get a new box so now I'm in the process of mailing the wire that powers the rake, the battery compartment cover, my receipt, and $10 so I can get a new one. I'm not too happy that I had to destroy my box with no guarantee they will send me a new one but I understand why they make you do it.  The Moral of the Story: Nothing makes a cat happier than a clean littler box and now that it's broken I simply can't keep it clean enough for them (in their opinions). I'm going to get the replacement and use it until it breaks too but I think I'm going to look into the toilet training kit.",3
"Great in concept, awful execution.  Disgusting to clean when the rake clogs up.  There are MUCH better products- Litter Robot- well worth the additional cash.",3
"I have owned two of these...the first was replaced for free by Walmart where I purchased it for the same price as here.  They are complex structures and I cannot imagine anyone who is not a handy man owning one for long.  I am and I find it a very poor implementation of a good design idea.  The good...it works and it keeps the bin ready for the next use.  The bad...it does not work for long before things get weak and then ultimately break it.  The thing still gets messed up and cleaning all the little corners and angles is a dirty job and it cannot be done with a hose because all the electronics are not protected in any way from water.  It is not a substitute when one goes away for more than 2 days.  I have two cats using this and not full time.  I needs to be emptied every two days. You must use good quality clumping litter.  The replacement canisters are expensive if you do not reuse them.  In fact, it is cheaper to just use a coventional litter pan and throw away the whole thing litter and all instead of using the refuse containers as throw away items.  The lids will fall off and need to be taped in place.  My unit burned out when one of the cats pulled out the power cord at the end of the unit.  It just kept getting fuller and fuller and I was gone for a few days.  Even though it is supposed to be protected from running when blocked, when I returned I found the unit almost extended to the refuse bin and the stupid wire which hangs out in the middle of the box had been tangled by one of the poor cats trying to use the unit when it broke.  BAD DESIGN!  I am ordering one of the rocking style units and returning my second unit.  By the way, the best litter boxes have strong curves at all corners so they are easy to clean.  Keep that in mind.",3
"Since it ""clicked"" a week after bringing her home, our 9 week old puppy has not missed her LitterMate automatic cleaning kitty litter box (with whole wheat litter).  There is poop in the collection container, so proof that she IS going. This machine works perfectly as described.  She has yet to pee in it though... but atleast that's not so gross as doggy poop.  Incase you or someone you know want to try to litter train their puppy, this is what we did:    1. Put litter box turned off in her room with puppy pads on it for a few days.    2. Emptied poop from pads (where she was going since we got her) into litter box (turned on).    3. After a few days, took the pads out of the box and turned box on.    4. Placed her in the box when we caught her going.    5. Made her watch us put poop in the box.  After she went the first time, she got to stay out almost all night, and we played with her immediately afterwards instead of keeping her locked in her ""room"" (large closet).  Since then, she has not missed.  It stinks for about 10 minutes until the sensors on the Littermate initiate scooping action.  Whole wheat kitty litter is dustless and naturally clumping.  I don't know of any other dogs trained to the automatic litter box, but litter training dogs has been catching on (judging by special dog boxes on the market)... but why do it that way when it can be self cleaning?!  (Needless to say, I am VERY satisfied with this product!!)",3
This works very good without all the back breaking scoping.  The only downside I see is with 2 cats you need to change the container more often.,3
"This is my second Littermaid.  My first worked great but my cat died so I sold it on Ebay.  However, it always worked well but you have to use the correct litter or the Littermaid will not work as advertised.  I never had a problem with the motor failing or other issues I've read in these reviews.  I also read that if the motor jams there is a reset that many user may not know about and this may be a reason for so many returns.  Once again in the year I used it the motor never stopped working.  The box is a bit noisy so I wouldn't suggest setting this in a bedroom.  Also, there is a chance that the rake moving and noise may scare your cat and they will not want to use it. Try setting it up with the power off for a few days and then turn it on after the cat gets use to using the box. The only other issue is that there is a raking motion that pushes all the waste forward but it also pushes good litter with it so the end result is good litter gets dumped into the plastic bin.  I had the option of buying the newer unit but read so many bad reviews that I decided to go for one of the older models.  I also build a table with a hole in it.  Then I cut out the bottom of the plastic container that catches the waste.  Now the unit dumps the waste into a 13 gallon trash bag and I can go quite a while without emptying it.  With the stock container you can go about 3 days with one cat.  If I wasn't setting up the table and larger bag I would look more closely at the Smart Scoop.  It seems to waste less litter.",3
"Received item, did not work properly.  Called LitterMaid and they told me to return to seller.  For the benefit of the doubt I had them send me another one.  Dealing with Amazon was very helpful and they were nice to me.  I received the replacement, and it would not shut off..back it went for a full refund.  I have owned a Littermaid in the past and it worked OK so I thought I would try again.....BAD EXPERIENCE.",3
